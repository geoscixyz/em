:numref:`ztem_elevmag` presents the ZTEM survey flight lines over the DEM (digital elevation model) and the aeromagnetic signature of the Cobre Panama region. The figure shows a correlation between relatively higher elevations and magnetic high anomalies over deposit area. The magnetic data shown in :numref:`ztem_elevmag` b shows a recognizable pattern of magnetic highs from volcanic andesites due to primary magnetite :cite:`burge2014`.

    ZTEM survey results over Cobre Panama deposit area: a) Digital Elevation
    Model (DEM), and b) Total magnetic intensity, showing
    porphyry deposit locations and drill-hole coverage prior to Balboa
    discovery (after :cite:`burge2014`).

As mentioned in previous :ref:`balboa_survey` section, measured tipper data have both :math:`T_{zx}` and :math:`T_{zy}`, and each of them has in-phase and quadrature components. :numref:`bboa_tipper_raw` shows ZTEM tipper data at 90 Hz. :math:`T_{zx}` data map shows large scale feature elongated to :math:`x`-direction, whereas :math:`T_{zy}` shows similar feature but elongated to :math:`y`-direction. Quadrature component data shows much smoother variation in space compared to in-phase data.
