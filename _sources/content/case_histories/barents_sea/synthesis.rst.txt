Synthesis
=========


This case study shows successful inversion of the seismic and CSEM derived
properties within a rock physics framework. The well and seismic data were
integrated to produce a litho-fluid facies volume identifying areas of clean
oil or fizz gas sand; however, the seismic data cannot distinguish between
commercial and non-commercial hydrocarbon saturation. The inclusion of the
CSEM resistivity information allows for the separation of these two possible
scenarios. Excellent correlation with known well results was achieved.

Multi-physics integration is not straightforward. There are a number of
technical challenges that were identified for consideration in future work.
For example, in the case study presented here, the reservoir interval was
relatively simple, comprising a single sand interval. Mapping the resistivity
into this layer was therefore relatively straightforward. However, in more
complex settings with multiple reservoir layers, that cannot be independently
resolved using the CSEM data, mapping from a low resolution resistivity image
into multiple layers is not straightforward. A workflow for dealing with this
situation must be developed. Rock physics strategies for correctly accounting
for anisotropy when linking electric and elastic measurements must also be
considered. However, despite this, the results demonstrate the value of
combining multiple geophysical data types to improve interpretation
robustness.
