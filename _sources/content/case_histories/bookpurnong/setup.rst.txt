Setup
=====

The survey area under investigation is along Murray River in the Bookpurnong
Irrigation District of the Riverland region of South Australia (:numref:`booky-location`).
The river regulation and irrigation along Murray River
have significantly changed the hydrology of the floodplain. One of the most
damaging consequences is the accumulation of salt in the plant root zone. Such
increased salinity of the floodplain soil has triggered decline in vegetation
health over years. In response to the ecological crisis, a major effort called
Living Murray Initiative was launched in 2002 to study and restore the
impacted hydrological system. As part of the Initiative, the Clarkâ€™s
Floodplain at Bookpurnong was chosen to examine the effectiveness of different
intervention methods from 2005 to 2008. Because of the link between
groundwater salinity and electric conductivity, electromagnetic (EM) methods
have been an integrated part of the project to test it as a cost-effective
tool for invasive monitoring. In this study, we analyze two airborne EM data
sets that assess the salinization at the regional scale. The primary
motivating questions are:

- How EM can be used to reconstruct an electrical conductivity model for the entire region?
- Can the conductivity model, a proxy of the severity of salinization, reveal
  the dynamics of groundwater flow?

Hydrological Background
-----------------------

The hydrological system concerning groundwater salinization at Bookpurnong
involves a highland and a floodplain as shown in :numref:`booky-hydro`. The
irrigation on the river bank (highland) has recharged the groundwater and
formed a hydraulic gradient towards the floodplain. The groundwater flow from
the high land to the the floodplain brings in substantial amount of natural
saline water to the river, causing tree health problems. In order to reduce
salt accumulation, Bookpurnong Salt Interception Scheme (SIS) is implemented
to experiment the water management methods that use pumping and flooding, with
a hope of replacing the saline water with fresh water.

    Hydrological model at Bookpurnong :cite:`viezzoli2009`.

In hydrology, the interaction between the riverwater and groundwater can be in
two modes (:numref:`lose-gain`). If the groundwater table is lower, the
riverwater recharges the groundwater aquifer, causing the river to "lose"
water. If the groundwater table is higher, the groundwater can recharge the
river, causing the river to "gain" water. Normally the former is the case if
the river is healthy. However, at Bookpurnong, the Murray River floodplain
salinization is associated with "gaining" saline water from the irrigated
highland. So the hydrological question here is where Murray River loses or
gains water, and whether the SIS improves the salinization. These questions
can be partially answered by hydrological drilling and sampling, but those
data are spatially confined. In this study, we will use EM methods to identify
the losing and gaining streams of Muaary River at Bookpurnong.
