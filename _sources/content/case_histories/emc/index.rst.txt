.. topic :: Prelude

    This case history is based upon the paper: "Three-Dimensional
    Inversion of ZTEM Data at the Elevenmile Canyon Geothermal System,
    Nevada" :cite:`DevrieseEtAl2012`. The research was presented at the
    Geothermal Resources Council conference in Reno, Nevada in 2012.

Compared to other case histories (i.e., :ref:`Aspen <aspen_index>`), which use
controlled-source airborne EM methods, this case history uses a natural source
airborne EM method called ZTEM. The goal of the research is to characterize a
geothermal system.

The following papers and reading material provide good background information
on the ZTEM method and geothermal systems in Nevada.

- "Numerical modeling of Z-TEM (airborne AFMAG) responses to guide exploration
  strategies" :cite:`lo08`

- "Three-dimensional inversion of ZTEM data" :cite:`holtham10`

- "Structure of the Dixie Valley Geothermal System, a "typical" Basin and Range
  geothermal system, from thermal and gravity data" :cite:`blackwell99`

- "Structure of the Inter-Basin Transition Zone between Dixie Valley and Fairview
  Valley, Nevada, USA" :cite:`mankhemthong08`
