..    - The Lalor deposit is a volcanogenic massive sulphide that is characterised as a stack of conductive ore lenses buried more than 600 m deep.
..    - Helicopter sub-audio magnetics (HeliSAM) survey using a ground large transmitter loop and an airborne total magnetic intensity magnetometer receiver was employed to measure the time-domain EM responses of the conductive ore bodies.
..    - The Lalor ore lenses, as well as another small sulphide-bearing argillite, are imaged by 3D inversion.
..    - Advanced inversion techniques, including warm-start and mesh refinement, were required to obtain high-quality 3D conductivity models.


The Lalor deposit is a massive sulphide that is characterized as a stack of conductive ore lenses buried more than 600 m deep. As of 2014, the deposit has a reserve of 15.2 Mt and an inferred resource of 10.1 Mt. Compared to typical Canadian gold deposits, the Lalor lake deposit has a grade 130% above the average.

In order to characterize the Lalor lake deposit, a helicopter sub-audio magnetic (HeliSAM) survey using a ground large transmitter loop and an airborne total magnetic intensity magnetometer receiver was employed to measure the time-domain EM responses of the conductive ore bodies. Using inversion, the Lalor ore lenses as well as small sulphide-bearing argillite units were successfully imaged in 3D. The successful inversion of the geophysical data was made possible through the use of warm-start and mesh refinement algorithms.
