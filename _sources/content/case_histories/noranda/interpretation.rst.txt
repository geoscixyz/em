                Using nine tiles.

"The final inversion models from the three and nine tiles examples are shown in :numref:`noranda5` and :numref:`noranda6` and recover the large-scale geologic features as well as several of the larger known mineralized regions that were not evident from the coarse inversion. The inversion results of the three and nine tiles examples are very similar, illustrating that the inversion results are not highly dependent on the choice of subdomain meshes." In addition, they compare very well to the true model (:numref:`noranda5a`).
