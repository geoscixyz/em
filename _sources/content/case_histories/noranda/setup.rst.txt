Setup
=====

The Noranda district is located near the Ontario and Quebec border in Canada and hosts a variety of mining deposits, including:

- 20 economic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits
  
- 19 orogenic gold deposits

- Several intrusion-hosted copper-molybdenum deposits

Because of the multitude of deposits in this region, it is a perfect candidate to explore regionally using airborne geophysics and specifically using natural sources. This case history uses a synthetic model based on the actual geology of the Noranda district and determines how the ZTEM method can be used to recover the large-scale geologic structures as well as the smaller, more local ore deposits.
