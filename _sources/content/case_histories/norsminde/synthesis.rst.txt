Synthesis
=========

The comparison between the SkyTEM results from the Norsminde catchment with 46 drillings demonstrate a very good or good correlation for 76% of the drillings. Only 6.5% of the drillings (three drillings) showed inconsistency. This proves that a good near-surface resolution has been achieved using properly engineered airborne system.

The results from this project open up new ground for employing airborne geophysics with confidence to create detailed near-surface geological models that can be used to map ground water recharge areas or areas where the groundwater may be vulnerable to the activities of humans.  Previous models of the SkyTEM system were focused on achieving increased depth of investigation to map the deep aquifers, but the newly developed SkyTEM system produces results that can also be used for a wide variety of near-surface geological mapping.  In particular, the technique can be applied to geological and hydrological exploration to locate shallower secondary aquifers, salt water encroachment, wetlands, pollution plumes or a detailed vulnerability mapping in the form of clay thickness maps.
