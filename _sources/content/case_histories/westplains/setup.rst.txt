    Location of Committee Bay Greenstone Belt within which the West Plains area resides.

The West Plains region resides in the South-West corner of the Committee Bay Greenstone Belt of Nunavut (:numref:`location_westplains`). A simplified geology map of West Plains is shown in :numref:`geology_westplains_setup` with the outline of overlapping frequency and time-domain AEM surveys in black.

The geology consists of a series of steeply dipping, near-surface ultramafic komatiite units shown in dark purple, named the Prince Albert Group, that cut through a sediment package shown in light purple :cite:`Kerswill1996`. The komatiites and sediments are bounded by granodiorites to the North-West and tonalites to the South-East. The komatiites contain the majority of the gold mineralization, and imaging their 3D nature to a higher degree represents the focal point of this study.

Geologic outcrops are scarce in the West Plains region, as the majority of the area is covered with a thin layer of glacial material.  As a result, the simplified geology map is compiled mainly from regional magnetic data analysis. This geologic interpretation does not include information from AEM data, which means the geologic interpretation from :numref:`geology_westplains_setup` has plenty of room for improvement based off 3D AEM inversion results. From the geology and drilling, it is believed that three conductive units exist, comprised of a Western main conductor, numbered 1 on :numref:`geology_westplains_setup`, and two near-parallel conductors in the East, numbered 2 and 3.
