DIGHEM is a frequency-domain multi-coil system operated by CGG. The system has evolved over years, 
but here we describe the basic specification of  the system based on DIGHEMV system.

The system consists of five pairs of coils operating at five discrete frequencies and in horizontal 
coplanar (HCP) or vertical coaxial (VCA) configurations as listed above. The actual operating frequencies 
can be slightly different from the nominal frequencies in the table. The measured data is the secondary 
magnetic field (Hs) normalized by the primary field (Hp) in part per million (ppm).


Flight
^^^^^^

DIGHEM has a nominal terrain clearance of 45 m and a nominal aircraft speed of 55 km/h. A typical sampling 
rate is 10 per second, equivalent to 1 sample every 3 m at a speed of 110 km/h. The aircraft is also equiped 
with the following ancillary instruments:

- Magnetometer
- Radar altimeter
- Video camera,
- Analog and digital recorders
- GPS navigation system
