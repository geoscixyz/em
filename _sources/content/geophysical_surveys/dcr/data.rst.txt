Data
====

.. purpose::

   To show how measured voltages are converted to apparent resistivity and
   plotted as a sounding curve or as a pseudo-section.

A general DC resistivity survey setup is outlined in
:numref:`dcr_DipoleDipole_array`. A current generator is attached to the
:math:`A` (positive) and :math:`B` (negative) electrodes and a current of
magnitude :math:`I` is injected. :math:`M` and :math:`N` are the potential
electrodes. The nomenclature for referring to the distance between any two
electrodes is denoted by :math:`r` with appropriate subscripts. The electrodes
can be deployed anywhere on the surface or in boreholes and they do not have
to be co-linear.

    The measured voltages constitute the data. Distances between the
    electrodes are used to calculate the geometry factor and apparent
    resistivity discussed below.

Measured potential differences
------------------------------

The flow of currents in the ground causes charges to be built up on interfaces
between regions of differing conductivity. These charges contribute to the
measured potential difference.

In a uniform halfspace, the measured potential difference is given by the
following expression:

.. math::
    \Delta V &= V_M - V_N \textrm{, with} \\[0.8em]
    V_M &= \frac{I \rho}{2 \pi} \left \{ \frac{1}{r_{AM}}  -  \frac{1}{r_{BM}} \right \} \textrm{ and}  \\[0.8em]
    V_N &= \frac{I \rho}{2 \pi} \left \{ \frac{1}{r_{AN}}  -  \frac{1}{r_{BN}} \right \} \textrm{, so} \\[0.8em]
    \Delta V &= \frac{I \rho}{2 \pi} \left \{ \frac{1}{r_{AM}} - \frac{1}{r_{BM}} - \frac{1}{r_{AN}} + \frac{1}{r_{BN}} \right \}\\[0.8em]
    \Delta V &=I \rho G

where :math:`G` is a geometric factor which depends upon the geometry of the electrodes,
:math:`I` is the magnitude of the injection current,  and :math:`\rho` is the halfspace resistivity.

.. _dcr_apparent_res:

Calculating apparent resistivity
--------------------------------

The measured voltages are numbers that can vary greatly in amplitude and they
provide no direct insight about the structures at depth. As shown above, the
potential difference is primarily dependent upon the geometry of the
electrodes. By rearranging that formula, we can recover the true resistivity

.. math::
        \rho = \frac{\Delta V}{IG}.

When the earth is a halfspace, any DCR datum is sufficient to evaluate the
halfspace resistivity. For field data, it is still useful to eliminate the
geometrical factor and define

.. math::
        \rho_a = \frac{\Delta V}{IG}.

We refer to :math:`\rho_a` as the *apparent resistivity* and it is understood
to be the resistivity of a halfspace which produces the observed potential
measured by a particular electrode geometry. Apparent resistivity is equal the
earth's true resistivity *only* when the earth is a uniform halfspace. When
the earth is more complicated, the measured apparent resistivity will lie
between the maximum and the minimum of the true resistivities. This conversion
of voltage measurements to apparent resistivity is extremely valuable for
plotting data and making first assessments about the subsurface. If apparent
conductivity is preferred (and these are often used interchangeably), the
expression becomes:

.. math::
        \sigma_a = \frac{1}{\rho_a} = \frac{IG}{\Delta V}.


Visualizing data
----------------

.. _dcr_sounding:

Sounding
********

For DC resistivity soundings, plots of the apparent resistivity versus current electrode
separation are often created. For simple horizontally layered
environments, these sounding curves provide insight into the relative thickness and
resistivity of layers (as shown in the interactive figure below).

.. _dcr_Pseudosection:

Pseudosection
*************

Pseudosections are often used to visualize data from 2D profiles. To account
for the fact that measurements with larger electrode separations sample deeper
portions of the earth, lines at :math:`45^\circ` degree angles, are drawn from
the mid-points of the current and potential electrode pairs and the datum is
plotted at the intersection of these lines. In cases where a pole transmitter
or receiver is used, the :math:`45^\circ` lines are drawn directly from the
electrode location. The figure below shows how an apparent resistivity pseudosection
is built for a simple dipole-dipole profile.

On the following :ref:`page <dcr_interpretation>`, we show how these plots can
be utilized to increase our understanding of the subsurface and discuss some
of their limitations.
