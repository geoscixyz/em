Transient Electric Dipole
=========================

.. Purpose::

    Here, we provide a physical description of the time-dependent electrical current dipole.
    This is used to develop a mathematical expression which can be used to replace the electrical source term in Maxwell's equations. 
    We then consider a transient electrical current dipole; which represents a more commonly used geophysical source.


**General Definition**

        	Physical representation of the time-dependent electrical current dipole source.


The time-dependent electrical current dipole can be thought of as an infinitesimally short length of wire which carries a time-dependent current.
The strength of the source is therefore defined by a time-dependent dipole moment :math:`\mathbf{p}(t)`.
For a time-dependent current dipole defined by length :math:`ds` and current vector :math:`\mathbf{I} (t)`, the dipole moment is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{I}(t) ds


As a result, the source term for the time-depedent electrical current dipole is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{j_e^s} = \mathbf{I}(t) ds \, \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)


where :math:`\delta (x)` is the Dirac delta function.
By including the source term, Maxwell's equations in the time domain are given by:


.. math::
	\begin{split}
	&\nabla \times \mathbf{e_e} + \mu \dfrac{\partial  \mathbf{h_e} }{\partial t} = 0  \\
	\nabla \times \mathbf{h_e} - \sigma \mathbf{e_e} & - \varepsilon \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{e_e} }{\partial t} = \mathbf{I}(t)ds \, \delta(x) \delta(y) \delta(z)
	\end{split}


where subscripts :math:`_e` remind us that we are considering an electric source.
The source current is responsible for generating a primary current density (and thus an electric field) in the surrounding region (:numref:`ElecDipoleTime`).
The :ref:`Ampere-Maxwell equation<ampere_maxwell_differential_time>` states that time-varying electric fields and the movement of free current generates magnetic fields.
In addition, the time-dependent nature of these magnetic fields should produce secondary electric fields according to :ref:`Faraday's law<faraday_differential_time>`.


**Transient Electrical Current Dipole**


The transient response represents the response of a system to step-off excitation.
For a transient electrical current dipole with infinitessimal length :math:`ds`, the electromagnetic response results from a step-off current of the form :math:`\mathbf{I} (t) = \mathbf{I} u(-t)`.
Thus the dipole moment is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{I}u(-t) ds


where :math:`u(t)` is the unit step function.
The source term for the corresponding electrical current dipole is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{j_e^s} = \mathbf{I}u(-t) ds \, \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)


where :math:`\delta (x)` is the Dirac delta function.
By including the source term, Maxwell's equations in the time domain are given by:


.. math::
	\begin{split}
	&\nabla \times \mathbf{e_e} + \mu \dfrac{\partial  \mathbf{h_e} }{\partial t} = 0  \\
	\nabla \times \mathbf{h_e} - \sigma \mathbf{e_e} & - \varepsilon \dfrac{\partial  \mathbf{e_e} }{\partial t} = \mathbf{I}u(-t)ds \, \delta(x) \delta(y) \delta(z)
	\end{split}


It is possible to solve this system to obtain analytic solutions for the transient electric and magnetic fields.
However, we will apply a different approach using the inverse Laplace transform.



**Organization**

In the following section, we solve Maxwell's equations for a transient electrical current dipole source and provide analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields within a homogeneous medium.
Asymptotic expressions are then provided for several cases.
Numerical modeling tools are made available for investigating the dependency of the electric and magnetic fields on various parameters.
