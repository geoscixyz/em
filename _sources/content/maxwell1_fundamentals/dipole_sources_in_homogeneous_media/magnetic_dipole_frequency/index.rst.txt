Harmonic Magnetic Dipole
========================

.. Purpose::

    In the frequency domain, we consider harmonic electric and magnetic fields.
    Here, we provide a physical description of the harmonic magnetic dipole.
    This is used to develop a mathematical expression which can be used to replace the magnetic source term in Maxwell's equations.


**General Definition**

The harmonic magnetic dipole can be thought of as an infinitessimally small loop which carries a harmonic current.
The strength of the source is therefore defined by a harmonic dipole moment :math:`\mathbf{m}(\omega)`.
For a harmonic magnetic dipole defined by vector surface area :math:`\mathbf{S}` and harmonic current :math:`I(\omega) = I e^{i\omega t}`, the dipole moment is given by:

		Physical representation of the magnetic dipole source where :math:`\mathbf{m}` = 1 Am :math:`\!^2`.


.. math::
	\mathbf{m} (\omega) = \mathbf{m} \, e^{i\omega t} = I \mathbf{S} \, e^{i\omega t}
	:label: m_harmonic_def

where :math:`\mathbf{m} = I \mathbf{S}` is the vector amplitude of the dipole moment.
When formulating Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain, :math:`e^{i\omega t}` is generally suppressed.
As a result, the source term for the harmonic magnetic dipole is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{J_m^s} = -i\omega \mu I\mathbf{S} \, \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)
	:label: Jm_harmonic_def

where :math:`\delta (x)` is the Dirac delta function.
By including the source term, Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain are given by:


.. math::
	\begin{split}
	\nabla \times \mathbf{E_m} & + i \omega  \mu \mathbf{H_m} = - i \omega \mu I \mathbf{S} \, \delta(x) \delta(y) \delta(z)  \\
	&\nabla \times \mathbf{H_m} - ( \sigma + i \omega \varepsilon ) \mathbf{E_m} = 0
	\end{split}
	:label: Maxwells_harmonic_Jm


where subscripts :math:`_m` remind us that we are considering a magnetic source.
The source is responsible for generating a primary magnetic field in the surrounding region (:numref:`MagDipole_freq`).
According to :ref:`Faraday's law<faraday_differential_frequency>`, the harmonic nature of the primary magnetic field generates rotational electric fields.
In matter, this leads to an induced current density which produces secondary magnetic fields according to the :ref:`Ampere-Maxwell equation<ampere_maxwell_differential_frequency>`.

**Organization**

In the following section, we solve Maxwell's equations for a harmonic magnetic dipole source and provide analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields within a homogeneous medium.
Asymptotic expressions are then provided for several cases.
Numerical modeling tools are made available for investigating the dependency of the electric and magnetic fields on various parameters.
