Transient Magnetic Dipole
=========================

.. Purpose::

    Here, we provide a physical description of the time-dependent magetic dipole.
    This is used to develop a mathematical expression which can be used to replace the magnetic source term in Maxwell's equations. 
    We then consider a transient magnetic dipole; which represents a more commonly used geophysical source.

        	Physical representation of the time-dependent magnetic dipole source.


The time-dependent magnetic dipole can be thought of as an infinitesimally small loop which carries a time-dependent current.
The strength of the source is therefore defined by a time-dependent dipole moment :math:`\mathbf{m}(t)`.
For a time-dependent magnetic dipole defined by surface area vector :math:`\mathbf{S}` and current :math:`I (t)`, the dipole moment is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{m}(t) = I(t)\mathbf{S}


As a result, the source term for the time-depedent magnetic dipole is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{j_m (r)} = - \dfrac{\partial I}{\partial t} \mathbf{S} \, \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)


where :math:`\delta (x)` is the Dirac delta function.
Notice how the source term contains a time-derivative of the loop's current.
By including the source term, Maxwell's equations in the time domain are given by:


.. math::
	\begin{split}
	\nabla \times \mathbf{e_m} + \mu \dfrac{ \mathbf{h_m} }{\partial t} &= - \dfrac{\partial I(t)}{\partial t} \mathbf{S} \, \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)  \\
	\nabla \times \mathbf{_m} - & \sigma \mathbf{e_m}  - \varepsilon \dfrac{\partial  \mathbf{e_m} }{\partial t} = 0
	\end{split}


where subscripts :math:`_m` remind us that we are considering a magnetic source.
The source is responsible for generating a primary magnetic field in the surrounding region (:numref:`MagDipoleTime`).
According to :ref:`Faraday's law<faraday_differential_time>`, time-varying magnetic fields generate rotational electric fields.
In matter, this leads to an induced current density which produces secondary magnetic fields according to the :ref:`Ampere-Maxwell equation<ampere_maxwell_differential_time>`.


**Transient Electrical Current Dipole**



The transient response represents the response of a system to step-off excitation.
For a transient magnetic dipole with surface area vector :math:`\mathbf{S}`, the electromagnetic response results from a step-off current of the form :math:`I (t) = I u(-t)`.
Thus the dipole moment is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{m}(t) = I u(-t) \mathbf{S}


where :math:`u(t)` is the unit step function and :math:`I` is the amplitude of the current at :math:`t \leq 0`.
The source term for the corresponding magnetic dipole is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{j_m^s} = I \delta(t) \mathbf{S} \, \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)


where :math:`\delta (x)` is the Dirac delta function.
By including the source term, Maxwell's equations in the time domain are given by:


.. math::
	\begin{align}
	\nabla \times \mathbf{e_m} + \mu \dfrac{\partial  \mathbf{h_m} }{\partial t} &= I \delta(t) \mathbf{S} \, \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)  \\
	\nabla \times \mathbf{h_m} - &\sigma \mathbf{e_m}  - \varepsilon \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{e_m} }{\partial t} = 0
	\end{align}


It is possible to solve this system to obtain analytic solutions for the transient electric and magnetic fields.
However, we will apply a different approach which uses the inverse Laplace transform.


**Organization**

In the following section, we solve Maxwell's equations for a transient magnetic dipole source and provide analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields within a homogeneous medium.
Asymptotic expressions are then provided for several cases.
Numerical modeling tools are made available for investigating the dependency of the electric and magnetic fields on various parameters.
