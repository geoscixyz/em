We can observe several characteristics of EM induction using the applet:

1) The voltmeter only registers a signal when the magnet is moving, regardless of its absolute position.
2) The sign of the induced voltage changes depending on the direction of motion and orientation of the magnet
3) The magnitude of the voltage depends on how quickly the magnet is moving
4) All else being equal, the voltage induced in the four coil loop is larger than in the two coil loop.

These behaviours are described by Faraday's law.
Faraday's law is named after English scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867),
and describes the manner in which time-varying magnetic fields induce the
rotational electric fields. This explains the electromagnetic induction
phenomenon, which is a fundamental excitation mechanism of the inductive
source.

.. _faraday_integral_time:

Integral Form in the Time-Domain
--------------------------------

Faraday's law in integral form can be expressed using the following equation:

.. math::
    \oint_C {\bf e} \cdot {\bf d}{\bf l}  = - \int_S \frac{\partial {\bf b}}{\partial t} \cdot \hat {\bf n} \, da,
    :label: faradays_law_int_time

where:

- :math:`\mathbf{e}` is the electric field defined around a closed path :math:`C`
- :math:`\mathbf{b}` is the magnetic flux density defined over a closed surface :math:`A` contoured by :math:`C`
- :math:`\hat n` is an outward normal unit vector perpendicular to :math:`da`
- :math:`\ d\mathbf{l}` is a vector element of length along contour :math:`C`

.. where :math:`{\bf e}` is the electric field defined around a closed path :math:`C`, :math:`{\bf b}` is the magnetic flux density defined over a closed surface :math:`A` contoured by :math:`C`, :math:`\hat n` is an outward normal unit vector perpendicular to :math:`da` , and :math:`d{\bf l}` is a vector element of length along contour :math:`C`.

Eq. :eq:`faradays_law_int_time` states that the time-dependent rate of change in magnetic flux, through a surface bounded by a closed path, is negatively proportional to the line integral of the electric field it induces over that path.

.. _faraday_differential_time:

Differential Form in the Time-Domain
------------------------------------

By applying Stokes's theorem to left-hand side of Eq.
:eq:`faradays_law_int_time`, we can obtain the differential form of Faraday's
law:

.. math::
    \nabla \times {\bf e} = - \, \frac{\partial {\bf b}}{\partial t}
    :label: faradays_law_diff_time

.. Therefore, the time dependent change in magnetic flux density at any location is negatively proportional to the curl of the electric field.
.. For magnetic fields which change rapidly with respect to time, we expect to observe a larger electric field.
.. TODO: Put some links: rotational field

Eq. :eq:`faradays_law_diff_time` states that time varying magnetic fields will
induce rotational electric fields. Furthermore, the curl of the induced
electric fields opposes time-dependent changes in the inducing magnetic field.


.. _faraday_differential_frequency:

Faraday's Law in the Frequency-Domain
-------------------------------------

The frequency-domain representation of Faraday's law can be obtained by
applying a Fourier transform to Eqs. :eq:`faradays_law_int_time` and
:eq:`faradays_law_diff_time`. The integral form of Faraday's law in the
frequency domain is:

.. math::
    \oint_C {\bf E} \cdot d{\bf l} = - \, i \omega \int_A {\bf B} \cdot \hat n \, da
    :label: faradays_law_int_freq

Similarly using Stokes' theorem, the differential form of Faraday's law is:

.. math::
    \nabla \times {\bf E} = - \, i \omega {\bf B}
    :label: faradays_law_diff_freq

where :math:`\omega` is the angular frequency, :math:`{\bf E}` is the
frequency-dependent electric field and :math:`{\bf B}` is the frequency-
dependent magnetic flux density.

.. Seogi: This is not very intuitive so possibly omit
.. From a theoretical perspective, it is common practice to consider :math:`{\bf E}` and :math:`{\bf B}` as sinusoidal functions.

From Eq. :eq:`faradays_law_diff_freq` , we can infer two things:

1. Induced rotational electric fields are proportional to the angular frequency; this implies that electromagnetic induction is larger at higher frequencies.
2. Induced rotational electric fields, and the frequency-dependent magnetic fields responsible for them, are 90 degrees out of phase.

.. that sinusoidal magnetic fields characterized by higher frequencies will result in stronger electric fields.
.. Seogi: I possibly need better wording about this.
.. We can see from Eq. :eq:`faradays_law_diff_freq` that sinusoidal magnetic fields characterized by higher frequencies will result in stronger electric fields.
.. , :math:`{\bf E}` is the frequency-dependent electric field and :math:`{\bf B}` is the frequency-dependent magnetic flux density.

Discovery of Faraday's Law
--------------------------

Faraday's law is best understood using three experiments, which Faraday
conducted and summarized in 1831. For each of these experiments, an
electromagnet was used to create a time-dependent magnetic field, which we
will represent using the magnetic flux density :math:`{\bf {b}}`. A loop of
wire with area :math:`A`, contoured by a closed path :math:`C`, was then held
in proximity of the electromagnet. This resulted in a magnetic flux
:math:`{\boldsymbol \Phi_b}` defined by:s

.. math::
    {\boldsymbol \Phi_b} = \int_A {\bf b} \cdot \hat {\bf{n}} \, da
    :label: magnetic_flux_time

Faraday then conducted the following three experiments:

1. The loop of wire was mobed while the electromagnet remained stationary.
2. The electromagnet was moved while the loop of wire remained stationary.
3. Both the loop of wire and electromagnet remained stationary, however, the strength of the magnetic field was varied as a function of time.

Faraday noticed that in all three experiments, an electromotive force
:math:`\mathcal{E}` was induced in the wire, resulting in a measurable
electric current. The electromotive force :math:`\mathcal{E}` can be defined
in terms of the electric field :math:`{\bf e}` by integrating over the path of
the wire as follows:

.. math::
    \mathcal{E} = - \oint_C {\bf e} \cdot d{\bf l} = V
    :label: electromotive_force_time

In an ideal circuit, the electromotive force is equivalent to the Voltage
:math:`V` experienced by the wire. For a circuit with resistance :math:`R`,
Ohm's law :math:`V=IR` can be used to show that electromotive forces are
associated with currents :math:`I`. Faraday's breakthrough came by proposing
that a time-dependent change in magnetic flux through the wire loop was
responsible for the resulting electromotive force. In 1833, Heinrich Lenz
determined that the time dependent change in magnetic flux was negatively
proportional to the electromotive force it generated. The contributions made
by Faraday and Lenz are represented by the following equation:

.. math::
    \mathcal{E} = - \, \frac{\partial {\boldsymbol \Phi_b}}{\partial t}
    :label: faraday_lenz_time

Lenz's contribution to Faraday's discovery not only provides the equality in
Eq. :eq:`faraday_lenz_time` , but determines the direction of force on free
charges in response to changes in an applied magnetic field. For a more
complete description see the :ref:`lenz` page. By substituting the definition
of magnetic flux from Eq. :eq:`magnetic_flux_time` and the definition of
electromotive force from Eq. :eq:`electromotive_force_time` into Eq.
:eq:`faraday_lenz_time`, we can obtain Faraday's law in integral form
according to Eq. :eq:`faradays_law_int_time` .

Consider the units of quantities on the left and right-hand sides of Eq.
:eq:`faradays_law_int_time`. Using dimensional analysis, we obtain:

.. math::
	V = \frac{Wb}{s}

.. TODO: parapharase this (I copy and paste wiki)

Therefore the above expression states that a change in magnetic flux, equal to
1 Weber per second, will induce an electromotive force of 1 Volt along a
closed path. Using the aforementionned expression, the Weber (:math:`Wb`) can
be expressed as:

.. math::
	Wb = V \cdot s = \frac{J}{A},

where :math:`J` is the Joule, and :math:`A` is Ampere.
Joules are used to represent a unit of energy, or work.
Thus we can interpret the magnetic flux as a unit of work per unit current.

Geophysical Applications Faraday's Law
--------------------------------------

When performing electromagnetic surveys, various instruments are used to
generate time-dependent magnetic fields. These fields are commonly refered to
as primary fields. According to Eqs. :eq:`faradays_law_diff_time` , this will
induce rotational electric fields within the surrounding region. For a rock
unit defined by conductivity :math:`\sigma`, Ohm's law (:math:`{\bf j} =
\sigma {\bf e}`) implies that a current density :math:`{\bf j}` is also
induced by the primary field. These induced currents are parallel to
:math:`{\bf e}` , and have a magnitude which depends on the physical
properties of the rock. Therefore, we can use Faraday's law in differential
form to understand the manner in which rotational currents are induced in
conductive objects, by an artificially generated primary field.

According to the Biot-Savart law Section :ref:`biot_savart`, current densities
are responsible for generating magnetic fields. This implies that currents
induced by the primary field will result in the creation of an anomalous
magnetic field, commonly refered to as the secondary field. The secondary
field can be measured at locations above the Earth's surface, and provides
important information regarding subsurface geological structures. But how is
the secondary field measured?

If placed in a region where secondary fields are observable, a receiver loop
of wire will experience an electromotive force according to Eq.
:eq:`faraday_lenz_time` . From Eq. :eq:`electromotive_force_time`, and we know
that the electromotive force is equivalent to the voltage being induced in the
wire. Therefore we can use voltage measurements to represent information
regarding the secondary field, as opposed to measuring the field directly.

The explanation provided in this section may also be understood in the
frequency-domain. However, the voltage induced within the receiver coils will
have both real (in-phase) and imaginary (out-of-phase) components.
