Apparent Resistivity
====================

The resistivity value obtained using simplified geometry and physics is known as the apparent resistivity. It is useful in providing a ball-park estimate of the Earth's electric properties. Various definitions for apparent resistivity will be provided when learning about :ref:`direct current resistivity<dcr_index>` and :ref:`magnetotelluric<mt_index>` methods.

Here, we present the definition for apparent resistivity which is most relevant to magnetotellurics. According to our quasi-static approximation for the impedance, where resistivity is the reciprocal of the conductivity:

.. math::
    \rho_{app} = \frac{1}{\sigma_{app}} = \frac{| Z_{xy}|^2}{\omega \mu}

Therefore, if perpendicular components of the electric and magnetic fields are known within a homogeneous medium, it is possible to estimate the electrical resisitivity of that medium; assuming also that the Earth is approximately non-permeable (:math:`\mu = \mu_0`). For a half-space model, the Earth's true resistivity is equal to the apparent resistivity.
