Overview of Maxwell's Equations
===============================

.. purpose::
	
	Having provided the set of :ref:`formative laws<formative_laws_index>` for electromagnetics, we present four common representations of Maxwell's equations. This page is meant to serve as a quick guide. For specific problems, it may be beneficial to begin from less common forms of Maxwell's equations. Please note however, that all forms can be derived from the expressions presented here.

Maxwell's equations are comprised of the first four :ref:`formative laws<formative_laws_index>`; i.e. :ref:`Gauss's law for electric fields<gauss_electric>`, :ref:`Gauss's law for magnetic fields<gauss_magnetic>`, :ref:`Faraday's law<faraday>` and the :ref:`Ampere-Maxwell law<ampere_maxwell>`. The equations can be written in various ways and characterize physical relationships between fields (e,h) and fluxes (b,d). Specific formulations can be obtained through use of the :ref:`constitutive relations<physical_properties_index>`. Maxwell's equations can be written in frequency or in time and in a differential or integral form:

(a) :ref:`differential_equations_time`
(b) :ref:`differential_equations_frequency`
(c) :ref:`integral_equations_time`
(d) :ref:`integral_equations_frequency`

This page is designed to be a quick access to the relevant equations with proper
:ref:`notation<introduction_notation>` and units. The equations are appropriate for EM fields in matter. If the fields are in free space, then the same constititive relations are used but with :math:`\sigma = 0`, :math:`\mu_0` and :math:`\varepsilon_0`. Constitutive equations are also written by assuming that the physical properties are isotropic and non-dispersive. Further elaboration about this can be found in :cite:`ward1988` (pp. 133) or on the :ref:`physical properties<physical_properties_index>` page. 

Variables and Units
-------------------

The variables and units for relevant quantities in Maxwell's equations are given here.
