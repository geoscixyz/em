Peak Velocity
=============

As the EM wave propagates, the peak depth moves as a function of time. The velocity at which the peak moves is called the peak velocity. By by taking time derivative of the :ref:`peak distance<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_peakdistance>` and setting it to zero, the peak velocity is given by:

.. math::
    v_{max} = \frac{d z_{max}}{dt} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\mu\sigma t}}

   Electric field as a function of time 100 m from a 1D impulse in the field in a 0.01 S/m whole space (a). Electric field at t = 0.03 ms as a function of distance (Modifed from :cite:`ward1988`) (b).
