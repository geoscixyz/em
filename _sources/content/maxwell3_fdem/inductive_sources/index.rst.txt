.. purpose::

    Using a loop source with the injection of sinusoidal current, we can
    excite the earth with EM induction. By exploring various types of EM
    fields in simple earth structure (e.g. half-space and layered earth), we
    understand principal physics of inductive excitation.

   A current loop source and magnetic field lines.

Mathematical definition of the inductive source can be

.. math::
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_e = 0

where :math:`\mathbf{J}_e` is a current source term in Ampere-Maxwell
equation:

.. math::
    \nabla \times \mathbf{B}  = \mathbf{J}_e + \mathbf{J}_f + i \omega \mathbf{D} + \nabla \times \mathbf{M}
    :label: ampere_maxwell

where :math:`\mathbf{J}_f = \sigma \mathbf{E}` is conduction currents,
:math:`\mathbf{D}=\epsilon \mathbf{E}` displacement currents, and
:math:`\mathbf{M}=\chi\mu_0\mathbf{H}` is mangnetization. Here :math:`\chi`
stands for magnetic susceptibility, and using this magnetic permeability can
be defined as :math:`\mu = \mu_0 (1+\chi)`. Using quasi-static approximation
we ignore displacement currents hence :eq:`ampere_maxwell` can be re-written
as

.. math::
    \nabla \times \mathbf{B}  = \mathbf{J}_f + \mathbf{J}_c + \nabla \times \mathbf{M}
    :label: ampere_maxwell_quasistatic

Both conduction currents, and magnetic currents (:math:`\nabla \times
\mathbf{M}`), will distorts EM fields, hence we investigate both conductivity
and susceptibility effects.

An inductive source is divergence free, indicating the current wire loop is
closed. Recalling DC resistivity, a current source, :math:`q` are expressed as

.. math::
    -\nabla \cdot \sigma \nabla \phi = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_e = -q = \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_s)I


From this, we can infer inductive source will not have any steady-state
electric field, because right hand side is zero for any inductive source.
However, there will be steady-state magnetic field everywhere due to the
currents flowing  in the loop as shown in :numref:`InductiveSource`. And this
current is oscillating so, upon :ref:`faraday` eddy current will be generated
in conductive earth medium. To understand fundamentals of EM induction in the
earth medium, we focus on a vertical magnetic dipole (VMD) case in simple
earth structures such as half-space and layered earth. Note that we have shown
if radius of the current loop source is small enough then considering the
current loop as magnetic dipole is reasonable assumption LinkXXX.

.. note::
  EM fields are complex-valued, hence they have both real (in-phase) and imaginary (out-of-phase or quadrature) component.
