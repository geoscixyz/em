Derivation of the Excitation Factor
===================================

.. Purpose::

	In this section, the excitation factor for a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere in free-space is derived according to Wait (:cite:`Wait1951`).

The geometry of this problem is illustrated in :numref:`SchelkunoffGeometry`, where :math:`{\bf H_0}(i\omega)` represents the inducing field, :math:`{\bf m}(i\omega)` is the induced magnetic dipole moment of the sphere, and :math:`{\bf H}(i\omega)` is the resulting dipole response.
:math:`\sigma_s`, :math:`\mu_s` and :math:`\varepsilon_s` represent the conductivity, magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of the sphere, respectively.
:math:`\sigma_b`, :math:`\mu_b` and :math:`\varepsilon_b` represent the conductivity, magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of the background media.

        Dipolar response :math:`{\bf H} (i\omega)` (purple) from a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere, under the influence of a spatially uniform, harmonic inducing field :math:`{\bf H_0} (i\omega)` (red). The induced dipole moment (blue) is represented by :math:`{\bf m} (i\omega)`.

Let us begin the derivation by considering Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain:

.. math::
	\begin{align}
	\nabla \times {\bf E} &= - i \omega \mu {\bf H}\\
	\nabla \times {\bf H} &= \big ( \sigma + i \omega \varepsilon \big ) {\bf E}
	\end{align}
	:label: Maxwell_Schelk

where :math:`\omega` is the angular frequency, :math:`\sigma` is the conductivity, :math:`\mu` is the magnetic permeability, and :math:`\varepsilon` is the electric permittivity.
According to Ward and Hohmann (1988), the electric field :math:`{\bf E}` and magnetic field intensity :math:`{\bf H}` may be written in terms of the following Schelkunoff potential :math:`{\bf F}`, where:

.. math::
	{\bf E} = - \nabla \times {\bf F}
	:label: SchelkunoffE

and

.. math::
	{\bf H} = - \big (\sigma + i \omega \varepsilon \big ) {\bf F} + \frac{1}{i \omega \mu} \nabla \big ( \nabla  \cdot {\bf F} \big )
	:label: SchelkunoffH

By subsituting Eqs. :eq:`SchelkunoffE` and :eq:`SchelkunoffH` into Maxwell's equations, we can obtain a wave equation in terms of the :math:`{\bf F}` potential:

.. math::
	\nabla^2 {\bf F} - \gamma^2 {\bf F} = 0
	:label: Schelkunoff_Wave

The wavenumber :math:`\gamma` depends on the physical properties of the media, and is given by:

.. math::
	\gamma = \Big [ i \omega \mu \sigma - \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon \Big ]^{1/2}
	:label: Wave_Number

For his derivation, Wait (:cite:`Wait1951`) considered the induced magnetic dipole moment resulting from an incident plane wave.
If the wavelength of the incident wave is sufficiently larger than the radius of the sphere (i.e. :math:`|\gamma_b |/2\pi \ll R`), then we may assume the magnetic field which excites the sphere is spatially uniform about the sphere.
For an inducing field of the form :math:`{\bf H_0} (i\omega) = H_0 e^{i\omega t} {\bf \hat z}`, symmetry of the problem implies that :math:`{\bf E}` only has components in :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat \phi}`.
Therefore by Eq. :eq:`SchelkunoffE`, it follows that our Schelkunoff potential will only have components in :math:`{\bf \hat z}` as well.

The Schulkunoff potential may be obtained by considering seperate solutions inside and outside of the sphere:

.. math::
	{\bf F} (\omega) = \begin{cases}
	F_b e^{i \omega t} {\bf \hat z} \; \; \textrm{  at  } \; \; r>R \\
	\\
	F_s e^{i \omega t} {\bf \hat z} \; \; \textrm{  at  } \; \; r<R
	\end{cases}
	:label: SolnsInsideOutside


For our problem, boundary conditions on the sphere require that tanjential components of the magnetic field and normal components of the flux density must be continuous.
According to Wait (:cite:`Wait1951`), these conditions are satisfied by the following expressions:

.. math::
	\textrm{At }r=R: \; \begin{cases}
	\dfrac{1}{r} \dfrac{\partial F_b}{\partial r} - \gamma_b^2 F_b = \dfrac{1}{r} \dfrac{\partial F_s}{\partial r} - \gamma_s^2 F_s \\
	  \\
	\mu_b \Bigg ( \dfrac{\partial^2 F_b}{\partial r^2} - \gamma_b^2 F_b \Bigg ) = \mu_s \Bigg ( \dfrac{\partial^2 F_s}{\partial r^2} - \gamma_s^2 F_s \Bigg )
	\end{cases}
	:label: BoundaryConditions

To solve the boundary value problem, Wait (:cite:`Wait1951`) expressed the solutions, both inside and outside of the sphere, as a sum of spherical harmonic modes with coefficients :math:`a_n` and :math:`b_n`, respectively.
For the boundary conditions to be satisfied however, he found that coefficients :math:`a_n=b_n=0 \; \forall \; n>0`.
As a result, the solution to the Schelkunoff potentials inside and outside the sphere are defined by:

.. math::
	F_b = - \frac{H_0 }{\sigma_b + i \omega \varepsilon_b} + i \omega \mu_b  \frac{e^{-\gamma_b r}}{r}a_0 H_0
	:label: Foutside

and

.. math::
	F_s = i \omega \mu_s \frac{sinh \big ( \gamma_s r \big )}{r} b_0 H_0
	:label: Finside

To determine the solution outside of the sphere, Eqs. :eq:`Foutside` and :eq:`Finside` may be substituted into Eq. :eq:`BoundaryConditions`.
Through meticulous algebra, coefficient :math:`a_0` can be expressed as:

.. math::
	a_0 \! =\! \frac{R^3}{2 e^{-\alpha_b}} \!\Bigg [ \! \frac{2\mu_s \big [ tanh(\alpha_s) - \alpha_s  \big ] + \mu_b \big [\alpha_s^2 \, tanh(\alpha_s) - \alpha_s + tanh(\alpha_s) \big ] }{\mu_s \big ( \alpha_b^2 +\alpha_b + 1 \big ) \big [ tanh(\alpha_s) - \alpha_s \big ] - \mu_b \big ( \alpha_b + 1 \big ) \big [ \alpha_s^2 \, tanh(\alpha_s) - \alpha_s + tanh(\alpha_s) \big ] } \! \Bigg ]
	:label: a0

where

.. math::
	\alpha_b = \gamma_b R = \Big [ i \omega \mu_b \sigma_b - \omega^2 \mu_b \varepsilon_b \Big ]^{1/2} R
	:label: alpha_b

and

.. math::
	\alpha_s = \gamma_s R = \Big [ i \omega \mu_s \sigma_s - \omega^2 \mu_s \varepsilon_s \Big ]^{1/2} R
	:label: alpha_s

The total magnetic field outside the sphere, in response to an inducing field of the form :math:`{\bf H_0} e^{i\omega t}`, may be obtained by substituting Eqs. :eq:`Foutside` and :eq:`a0` into Eq. :eq:`SchelkunoffH`.
Note that our derivation of :math:`a_0` did not require us to include the frequency-dependent term :math:`e^{i\omega t}` of the primary field.
Therefore, we may generalize our solution for any harmonic inducing field of the form :math:`{\bf H_0} (i\omega )`.

If the sphere lies within a resistive background (:math:`\sigma_b \ll \sigma_s`, :math:`\mu_b = \mu_0`, and :math:`\varepsilon_b = \varepsilon_0`), and if electric displacement within the sphere is neglected (:math:`\omega \varepsilon_s \ll \sigma_s`), then Eq. :eq:`a0` reduces to:

.. math::
	a_0 \! =\! \frac{R^3}{2} \!\Bigg [ \! \frac{2\mu_s \big [ tanh(\alpha) - \alpha  \big ] + \mu_0 \big [\alpha^2 \, tanh(\alpha) - \alpha + tanh(\alpha) \big ] }{\mu_s \big [ tanh(\alpha) - \alpha \big ] - \mu_0 \big [ \alpha^2 \, tanh(\alpha) - \alpha + tanh(\alpha) \big ] } \! \Bigg ]
	:label: a0reduced

where

.. math::
	\alpha = \Big [ i\omega \mu_s \sigma_s \Big ]^{1/2}R
	:label: alpha

Wait (:cite:`Wait1951`) simplified the solution outside the sphere by considering the dipole field within a vacuum.
For a dipole moment :math:`{\bf m} (i\omega)`, the dipole field :math:`{\bf H} (i\omega)` is given by (Griffiths, 1999):

.. math::
	{\bf H} (i \omega) =\frac{1}{4\pi} \Bigg [ \frac{3 {\bf r} \; \big [ {\bf m} (i\omega) \cdot {\bf r} \; \big ]}{r^5} - \frac{{\bf m} (i\omega) }{r^3} \Bigg ]
	:label: DipoleField

where :math:`{\bf r}` defines the spatial vector from :math:`P` to :math:`Q`.
The dipole field was derived by performing a multipole expansion on Eq. :eq:`Foutside`, and neglecting higher order terms.
This lead to an explicit expression for the magnetic dipole moment in terms of coefficient :math:`a_0`, where:

.. math::
	{\bf m} (i \omega) = 4 \pi a_0 {\bf H_0} (i \omega) = \frac{4\pi}{3}R^3 \chi (i \omega) {\bf H_0} (i \omega)
	:label: DipoleMoment

According the Eq. :eq:`DipoleMoment`, :math:`{\bf m} (i\omega)` may also be expressed as the product of the inducing field, the sphere's volume, and an excitation factor :math:`\chi (i\omega)`, where:

.. math::
	\chi (i \omega) = \frac{3}{2} \Bigg [ \! \frac{2\mu_s \big [ tanh(\alpha) - \alpha  \big ] + \mu_0 \big [\alpha^2 \, tanh(\alpha) - \alpha + tanh(\alpha) \big ] }{\mu_s  \big [ tanh(\alpha) - \alpha \big ] - \mu_0 [ \alpha^2 \, tanh(\alpha) - \alpha + tanh(\alpha) \big ] } \! \Bigg ]
