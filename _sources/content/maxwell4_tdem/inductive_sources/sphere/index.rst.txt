.. Purpose::

	Here, we consider the dipole response from a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere in free-space. Analytic expressions presented here were derived by Wait and Spies (:cite:`WaitSpies1969`). These expressions can be used to explore the nature of time-domain responses generated by compact ore-bodies and unexploded ordnance items within resistive media. Thus by understanding the response from a sphere, we can gain insight regarding practical geophysical scenarios.

Introduction
------------

For a compact target within a resistive medium, the time-domain response can be understood by considering the problem geometry illustrated in :numref:`figProblemGeometryTEM`; where the target has conductivity :math:`\sigma` and magnetic permeability :math:`\mu`, and the host medium has conductivity :math:`\sigma_b` and magnetic permeability :math:`\mu_b = \mu_0`. In this case, the transmitter (:math:`Tx`) generates a time-dependent primary field :math:`\mathbf{h_p} (t)`, which induces an excitation within the target. The excitation induced within the target produces a secondary field :math:`\mathbf{h_s} (t)`, which is then measured by a receiver coil (:math:`Rx`).

On a fundamental level, the geophysical problem illustrated in :numref:`figProblemGeometryTEM` may be understood by considering a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere in free-space (:numref:`figSphereTEMfreespace`). This is accomplished by assuming the attenuation (link) of EM signals, and inductive responses from the host media, are negligible. For the free-space problem, background physical properties are now given by :math:`\sigma_b = 0` and :math:`\mu_b = \mu_0`, and the primary field :math:`\mathbf{h_0} (t)` may be calculated using the :ref:`Biot-Savart law<biot_savart>`. The free-space problem will act as the basis for our analysis of time-domain responses.




Outline
-------

The analysis presented in this section follows expressions derived by Wait and Spies (:cite:`WaitSpies1969`). Wait and Spies considered the free-space dipole response from a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere, under the influence of a spatially uniform field. Our analysis of the sphere's time-domain response is presented in four parts:

1. :ref:`General Formulation<SphereTEM_general_formulation>`: Here, a general formulation for the sphere's time-domain response is presented according to Wait and Spies (:cite:`WaitSpies1969`).
These expressions characterize the sphere's dipole response under the influence of a spatially uniform time-dependent field.

2. :ref:`Transient Response<SphereTEM_transient_response>`: In many cases, we are interested in the transient or "step-off" response from a target body.
This is a fundamental response of great importance in geophysics.
Here, we examine the sphere's transient response and how it depends on the sphere's physical properties.

3. :ref:`Impulse Response<SphereTEM_impulse_response>`: The sphere's time-dependent response to an arbitrary primary field is characterized by its impulse response.
Here, the impulse response for a permeable and a non-permeable sphere are discussed.

4. :ref:`Analytic Derivation<SphereTEM_analytic_derivation>`: Here, abbreviated derivations for the sphere's step-response and impulse response are presented for a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere.
These derivations can be found in Spies (:cite:`Wait1951`) and Wait and Spies (:cite:`WaitSpies1969`).
