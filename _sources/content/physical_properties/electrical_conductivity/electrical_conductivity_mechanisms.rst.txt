Mechanisms for Conductivity and Chargeability
=============================================

Electric and Ionic Conduction
-----------------------------

Conduction describes the movement of electrical charge from one location
to another. There are two important charge carriers of electrical charge, electrons and ions. Let us define the conductivity as follows:

.. math::
	\sigma = n e \mu_e,

where :math:`n` is the number of charge carriers, :math:`e` is charge carried
by each charge carrier, and :math:`\mu_e` is the mobility of the carriers. By this definition,
the conductivity of a rock can be determined by its capability to move charges via electrons and ions. This results in two distinct types of conduction: electric conduction and ionic conduction. Both conductions are related to random motion of particles affected by an
applied electric field. However, how charge moves in each conduction process is
quite different.

Electric Conductivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The charge carrier for electric conductivity is the electron, which defines conduction within most metals such as iron and copper. The sharing of valence electrons between metallic atoms allows charges to move freely along the directly of an applied electric field.

Ionic conductivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Conduction within most rocks is primarily electrolytic, taking place in the
connected pore spaces, along grain boundaries and in fractures. Conduction within rocks is typically negligible through the mineral grains or silicate framework :cite:`ward1990`. In this
case, the charge carrier mostly consists of dissolved ions; which is why we use the term ionic conductivity.

Ionic conductivity results from the ordered movement of ions in an
electrolyte under the application of an external electric field. Without an
external electric field, the ions move randomly as a result of thermal
agitation and collisions with other ions and atoms. Because both cations (+)
and anions (-) are present in an electrolyte, the conductivity can be
expressed as

.. math::
	\sigma = e(n^+\mu_m^+ + n^-\mu_m^-),

where :math:`n` is the number of charge carriers, :math:`e` is the charge
carried, and :math:`\mu_m` is the mobility of the carriers. Here superscripts
+ and - stand for cation and anion, respectively.


Electrode and Membrane Polarization
-----------------------------------

The chargeability of Earth materials is essentially an electrochemical effect and can be
caused by many factors, not all of which are completely understood. If the ground
is chargeable, it responds as if the resistivity were a complex quantity - it
behaves somewhat like a leaky capacitor. Therefore the chargeability can be
measured in a number of ways using time domain or frequency domain techniques.
Aspects affecting the chargeability of a sample include:

..     - the grain size of particles in the sample;
..     - the type and mobility of ions within the pore fluids;
..     - the details of microscopic interactions between solid surfaces and fluids;
..     - the amount of surface area within a specific volume.

.. The surface area-to-volume ratio is an important factor. Clays tend to be
.. chargeable while sandstones are not, and the images here illustrate one reason
.. why this is true. In addition, the surface interactions between clay minerals
.. and fluids enhance the ability of these materials to hold charges.

There are two primary causes of chargeability, "membrane polarization" and
"electrode polarization". In both cases, the re-distribution of charges after an external DC electric field is applied takes some time to occur. Equivalently, it takes the same amount of time to revert back to a balanced charge distribution once the electric field is removed.

..     - Induced polarization is greater when there are larger regions of
..       adsorbed anomalous charge (adjacent to an interface); i.e. when there is
..       a large surface area-to-volume ratio.

..     - Non-ionic fluids (such as contaminants) can markedly change the
..       behavior of surface-electrolyte interactions.

..     - Changes in ion concentration (such as increased salinity) will also
..       affect both types of polarization.

..     - Both effects (membrane and electrode polarization) are related to grain
..       size as much as material type. Therefore, discrimination of mineral type
..       on the basis of chargeability alone is not recommended.

Electrode Polarization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Electrode polarization occurs when pore spaces are blocked by metallic particles (:numref:`fig_elec_pol_1` ). Again, charges accumulate when an electric field is applied. The result is two electrical double layers which contribute to measured voltages (:numref:`fig_elec_pol_2` ).

At interfaces between ionic and metallic conductors (for example, an ore
grain within the pore space), there is an impedance associated with getting current to
flow across the interfaces. These interfaces look like those illustrating in :numref:`fig_elec_pol_1` and have a simplified circuit analogue shown in :numref:`fig_elec_pol_4`. Current can flow across these interfaces via 1) charge transfer (or ion diffusion), or 2) via a capacitive effect (no charge transfer).

Ion diffusion is not easy to model with circuit elements. Instead, this process is frequently described using the Warburg impedance and reaction resistance. The magnitude of the Warburg impedance varies approximately as :math:`\omega^{-1/2}`. Therefore, the impedance due to ion diffusion actually increases as the frequency decreases.

Note that while it is useful to understand simplified models of the relevant
electrical behaviors of surface-electrolyte interactions, all rocks are "dirty" in the sense that they are not simply pure "electrodes". There are other materials and particles affecting ionic behavior within and outside the diffuse layer, and some of the sample's constituents will affect the behavior of the fixed layer near and on the liquid-solid interfaces. This has resulted in the creation of many empirical models for describing surface-electrolyte interactions.

		Net electric dipole.

Membrane polarization occurs when pore space narrows to within several
boundary layer thicknesses (which are the thicknesses of ions adsorbed into a
surface). Note that the surfaces of mineral grains naturally possess a weak negative charge which attracts cations (:numref:`fig_memb_pol_1`).

When an electric field is applied, the charges cannot flow easily through the "pore throat" so they accumulate (:numref:`fig_memb_pol_2`). The result is a net electric dipole which contributes towards any other voltages measured across the rock. Like electrode polarization, this process is non-instantaneous.

A second form of membrane polarization occurs where clay particles partially block ionic solution pathways (:numref:`fig_memb_pol_4`). Upon application of an electric field, positive
charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers accumulate. This is known as an "ion-selective membrane."

A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end of the membrane, while
a deficiency occurs at the other end. The reduction of mobility is most
obvious at frequencies slower than the diffusion time of ions between adjacent
membrane zones; i.e. slower than around 0.1 Hz. Conductivity increases at
higher frequencies.
