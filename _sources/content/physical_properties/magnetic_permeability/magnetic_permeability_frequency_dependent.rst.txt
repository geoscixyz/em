Frequency-Dependent Magnetic Permeability
=========================================

In response to changes in an applied magnetic field, the induced magnetization
within most rocks may be considered an instantaneous process. For some
lateritic soils and rapidly cooled basalts however, a portion of the induced
magnetization undergoes a relaxation process. This relaxation process is
commonly referred to as: viscous remanent magnetization, magnetic viscosity, or
magnetic after-effect. As a result of their magnetic viscosity, lateritic
soils and rapidly cooled basalts are characterized by frequency-dependent
magnetic permeabilities.

Here, our description of the magnetic viscosity is limited to providing useful
expressions for implementation in applied problems. Comprehensive studies of
magnetic viscosity, and its relevance to geophysical surveying, may be found
in (:cite:`Neel1949,Buselli1982,Lee1984,Dabasetal1992,DunlopOzdemir1997,Das2006,Pasion2007`).

Mathematical Description
------------------------

For rocks which are characterized by frequency-dependent magnetic
permeabilities, the :ref:`magnetic constitutive relationship
<magnetic_permeability_index>` becomes:

.. math::
    {\bf B}(\omega) = \mu (\omega) \, {\bf H}(\omega)
    :label: FreqConstRel

where :math:`\mu (\omega)` may also be characterized a frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility :math:`\chi (\omega)`:

.. math::
    \mu (\omega) = \mu_0 \big [ 1 + \chi (\omega) \, \big ]
    :label: SuscPermRel

As presented in :ref:`magnetism in rocks <magnetic_permeability_magnetism>`, magnetic
susceptibility represents the proportional degree of induced magnetization, in
response to an applied magnetic field. For rocks exhibiting magnetic
viscosity, the relaxation process may be understood by considering a Debye
model:

.. math::
    \chi(\omega) = \chi_\infty + \frac{\chi_0 - \chi_\infty}{1 + i \omega \tau}
    :label: EqDebye


where :math:`\chi_0` defines the zero-frequency limit, :math:`\chi_\infty`
defines the infinite frequency limit, and :math:`\tau` defines the rate of
magnetic relaxation. The instantaneous portion of induced magnetization is
represented by :math:`\chi_\infty`, whereas :math:`\chi_0-\chi_\infty`
represents the viscous contribution. In rocks, the magnetic viscosity is
characterized by a distribution of time-relaxation constants. This can be
represented by introducing a weighting function :math:`f(\tau)`, and
integrating over all Debye models:

.. math::
    \chi (\omega) = \chi_\infty + \big ( \chi_0 - \chi_\infty \big ) \int_0^\infty \frac{f(\tau)}{1 + i\omega\tau} d\tau
    :label: EqWeigthFcn

The magnetic viscosity of a rock ultimately depends on the distribution of
time relaxation constants. From expression :eq:`EqWeigthFcn`, a multitude of
models have been proposed. One of the simplest and most popular models is
obtained by assuming a log-uniform distribution of time relaxation constants:

.. math::
    \chi(\omega) = \chi_0 - \frac{\chi_0 - \chi_\infty}{ln (\tau_2/\tau_1)} ln \Bigg ( \frac{1 + i\omega\tau_2}{1 + i\omega\tau_1} \Bigg )
    :label: EqLogUniform

where :math:`\tau_1` and :math:`\tau_2` represent lower and upper bounds for
distribution. A specific weighting function may also be used to obtain the
Cole-Cole model:

.. math::
    \chi(\omega) = \chi_\infty + \frac{\chi_0 - \chi_\infty}{1 + (i \omega \tau_c)^\alpha}
    :label: EqColeCole

where :math:`\tau_c` represents the center of a distribution of time-
relaxation constants, and :math:`\alpha` represents the broadness of the
distribution. The frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibilities for a Debye
model, log-uniform distribution, and Cole-Cole model are compared in :numref:`figMuFrequency`.
