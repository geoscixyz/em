        Electromagnetic surveys can be collected in the air, on the surface,
        and in boreholes, covering different scales and allowing different
        targets to be imaged. These methods are sensitive to electrical
        resistivity, which varies as geologic formations change. In this case
        history, airborne EM is used to characterize the background geology of
        the Athabasca oil sands where Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage is
        planned for the future. The case study is based on the extended
        abstract "From exploration to reclamation: using EM methods at SAGD
        sites in the Athabasca oil sands" :cite:`DevrieseOldenburg2016a`. The
        readers can anticipate to learn the following:

1. How EM can be applied to heavy oil studies

2. Airborne EM acquisition system and airborne data

3. Limitations of different EM surveys
