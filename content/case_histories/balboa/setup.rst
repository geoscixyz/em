Setup
=====

The Balboa deposit is named after the explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa who
travelled across the Panama isthmus to discover the Pacific Ocean in 1513
:cite:`burge2014`. Balboa was discovered in 2010 at the Cobre Panama Cu-Mo-Au
porphyry project, situated 20 km from the Caribbean coast and 120 km west of
Panama City. Balboa is the westernmost of a cluster of six tabular shallowly-
dipping, calc-alkaline porphyry copper deposits at Cobre Panama
(:numref:`bboa_setup`) that are related to porphyritic intrusions on the
southern margin of a granodiorite batholith. Modern exploration at Cobre
Panama began in 1966, led primarily by soil geochemistry and drilling. Cobre
Panama consists of a measured and indicated mineral resource of 3,695 Mt at
0.37% Cu, 0.006% Mo, 1.3 g/t Ag and 0.07 g/t Au :cite:`gray2015`. By 2011,
Balboa’s indicated and inferred copper and gold resource had increased Cobre
Panama’s total by 19% and 29%, respectively (Engineering & Mining Journal
News, 17-April-2012; www.e-mj.com), making it a significant exploration find.
Balboa is located just 1 to 2 km from known deposits and measures more than
1,500 by 1,000 m in surface area, yet it escaped detection despite 40 years of
exploration, in part due to leaching of copper during the surficial
development of 20-30m of clay-rich saprolite in the project area. A property
wide ZTEM survey in late 2010 was carried out and follow-up drilling of a ZTEM
anomaly led to the blind discovery, lying just 60m below the surface. All of
this happened within 3 months after the completion of the ZTEM survey.
:cite:`burge2014` first presented the Balboa ZTEM discovery and it was
subsequently described in :cite:`fiscor2014`.

Geology
-------

The Cobre Panama cluster of six copper-molybdenum-gold deposits is distributed
over an area of ~10 x 5 km on the southern margin of the Petaquilla batholith
:numref:`bboa_geomap`. This granodioritic batholith yields U-Pb zircon ages
from about 32 to 28 Ma :cite:`hollings2013`, with the younger end of the
spread playing host to the copper mineralisation. Porphyry intrusions form a
continuum from the batholithic composition to a feldspar-quartz-hornblende
phase that contains slightly higher grade copper mineralisation.
Contemporaneous, fine-grained, weakly magnetic andesite flow units cover much
of the area and variably host mineralisation, and barren, post-mineral
andesite dikes cut the mineralised porphyries. Since exhumation of the system,
a tropical saprolite profile up to 30 m thick has developed. This profile is
incised in the drainage valleys, which provide the only rare glimpses of
outcrop. The transition from saprolite to fresh rock occurs quite rapidly over
a few metres of saprock.

Alteration is mostly chlorite and chlorite-sericite. This overprints potassic
alteration, but there are only rare patches of biotite and potassium feldspar
alteration preserved. Quartz sulphide ± magnetite A and B veinlets provide
widespread evidence of former potassic alteration. Disseminated chalcopyrite,
pyrite and magnetite are abundant and often replace mafic phenocrysts with
chlorite. Early mineral assemblages are overprinted by phyllic alteration that
includes white and green sericite and ubiquitous pyrite with variable
silicification or quartz veining.
