<p>In order to resolve the interpretation ambiguity inherent when only seismic
data are considered, we used resistivity information derived from controlled
source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. CSEM has been used successfully as an
offshore hydrocarbon exploration tool for over a decade

relatively new way; using a towed source and array of electric field receivers

the various acquisition methods that can be applied.</p>
<p>The CSEM analysis was focused on line 5001. A 2.5D inversion approach, in
which the earth structure is 2D and the source is a 3D point dipole,  was
therefore applied.  Although this does not take into account the full 3D
structure of the earth, in many circumstances it provides a good approximation
to the resistivity structure along the line inverted.  The effect of this
approximation on the results is discussed in more detail below.
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-csem-amplitude-phase"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 329</span></a> shows an example of the CSEM acquired along
line 5001, in the form of source gathers at 1Hz. A significant response to the
accumulation encountered at Wisting Central can be clearly seen in the CSEM
data, particularly in the phase response (lower panel of
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-csem-amplitude-phase"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 329</span></a> around 611km Easting). This is observed
across a wide band of frequencies. It should be noted that it is somewhat
unusual to see such a large reservoir response in the data directly. In this
case the oil accumulation at Wisting is both extremely resistive (several
thousand Ωm) and at a relatively shallow depth below mudline (about 300m)
leading to the large response observed.</p>

<p>The CSEM data for six frequencies (0.2Hz, 0.8Hz, 1Hz, 1.4Hz, 2.2Hz, 2.6Hz)
were inverted using an Occam approach (<span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id96" title="Steven C. Constable, Robert L. Parker, and Catherine G. Constable.

derive anisotropic resistivity models that are smooth in a first derivative
sense, and therefore as close to a uniform halfspace as possible, while
honoring the data. A layered seawater conductivity structure based on
measurements throughout the water column and 1D modeling was used. Nineteen to
twenty-three source-receiver pairs per frequency were included in inversion.</p>
<p>The inversion was performed in stages. Firstly, an unconstrained inversion was
run in order to examine the resistivity structure obtained in the absence of
any a priori information. However unconstrained inversions in general have
poor resolution. Resolution can be improved by including structural
information from the seismic data. This also ensures consistency between
seismic and CSEM derived results, which is important for subsequent integrated
interpretation.  Following unconstrained 2.5D inversion therefore, seismic
data were used to condition the inversion of the CSEM data by adding
structural constraint in the form of breaks in the smoothness requirement at
selected seismic horizons, thereby improving the resolution of the CSEM
result. Two versions of constrained inversion were run, one with a
regularization break at reservoir level (top Stø ) only, and one with
regularization breaks at both top Stø and the Intra-Snadd horizon. After
initial constrained inversion testing, the resistivity was limited between 0.1
to 40 Ωm from seafloor to top Stø for both horizontal and vertical
resistivity.</p>

<p>Background resistivity is extremely high in the area with vertical resistivity
of 25-30 Ωm. Background anisotropy is also extremely high with factors of
five or more observed. This high overburden resistivity and anisotropy is the
result of the significant uplift in the area. A significant increase in
vertical resistivity was recovered in the lower Snadd, with localized
variations contained within a regional feature. This regional feature also
exhibits extremely high electrical anisotropy.</p>
<p>A localized resistive feature coincident with the structure penetrated at
Wisting Central is clearly recovered in the vertical resistivity. A more
subtle increase in resistivity is observed at the Hanssen well location. No
localized resistive feature is recovered in the Stø at the location of the
Wisting Alternative or Bjaaland wells.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-hydrocarbon-saturation"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 341</span></a> shows the CSEM-derived vertical resistivity in the same windows of analysis

previously shown in the <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inversion-vertical-resistivity"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 330</span></a>.</p>
<p>A qualitative interpretation of the CSEM inversion results supports the
outcome of the Alternative, Central and Bjaaland wells. A prominent
resistivity anomaly is recovered at Central, in which there was a significant
oil discovery, which is in agreement with the high resistivity values measured
at the reservoir location. On the other hand, the Realgrunnen structures
penetrated at Alternative and Bjaaland, two dry wells, are related to low
resistivity values that support the petrophysical outcome. At the location of
the Hanssen discovery well, a subtle high resistivity anomaly is observed. The
relatively small magnitude of this feature is the product of a 3D effect in
the CSEM data, a consequence of the location of the CSEM line with respect to
the location and the size of the reservoir (see
<a class="reference internal" href="setup.html#fig-geology-region-map-setup"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 322</span></a> b).   Although in many circumstances
the 2.5D approximation is a good one, if the resistive reservoir is relatively
small, or the 2D line being inverted is close to the edge of the reservoir,
then the effect of the of the reservoir on the CSEM data is diminished, and
consequently the resistivity recovered by a 2.5D inversion is reduced from its
true value.  Loseth et al. illustrate this with a synthetic modelling study in
which they demonstrate the reduction in inverted resistivity with width of the
target reservoir and proximity of the CSEM line to the reservoir edge. In the
case of Hanssen, the reservoir is both relatively small and the line is close
to the edge of the body, leading to the lower resistivity at this location.
The effect of this on the quantitative interpretation is discussed in later
sections.</p>

<section id="seismic-data">
<h2>Seismic Data<a class="headerlink" href="#seismic-data" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The ultimate quality of any inversion depends on the quality of the input
data, and to ensure a robust result, data must be optimally conditioned for
the workflow to be applied. In this example, the input seismic offset gathers
were pre-conditioned prior to inversion to increase the overall signal-to-
noise ratio and avoid any remaining noise having a high impact on the
inversion results. The pre-conditioning also corrected for offset dependent
frequency loss and ensured that the gathers were aligned. Since data pre-
conditioning, if not applied carefully, could significantly affect AVO
behavior of target reflectors, the sensitivity of inversion results to the
pre-conditioning approaches applied has been thoroughly tested and analyzed.
It is important to note that all conditioning steps were parameterized keeping
in mind the need to preserve amplitude behavior, and the minimum possible pre-
conditioning was undertaken. The processes applied are summarized in
<span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id107" title="S. Singleton. The effects of seismic data conditioning on prestack simultaneous impedance inversion. The Leading Edge, pages 772-781, 2009.">Sin09</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>During the pre-stack seismic inversion, a global objective function is
minimized in order to compute an optimal model for P- and S-impedance, which
best explains the input angle stacks and is consistent with the geological
knowledge introduced through a priori information (<span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id108" title="T. Tonellot, D. Mace, and V. Richard. Joint stratigraphic inversion of angle-limited stacks. SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstract, pages 227-230, 2001.">TMR01</a>]</span>).
Initial low frequency, models of P- and S-impedance were created based on
seismic velocity and well data. These models exclude any reservoir signature
and mix the lateral variations from the velocity field and vertical resolution
from wells logs filtered at 5Hz. Wavelets were extracted per angle stack per
well and later combined to obtain the most representative wavelet for each
angle stack. Additional parameters such as scale factor between wavelets and
actual amplitude sections, confidence in seismic amplitude angle stack data,
number of iterations and allowed low frequency model standard deviations were
also customized based on iterative tests performed per set of lines. Final
results were then extracted along well trajectories and compared to actual
well log data in order to ensure a good representation of the earth model.
Also, percentage of differences between input and synthetic angle stacks were
calculated to ensure that they were less than 20% of the original seismic
amplitude. In this case, where the P- and S-impedance models were allowed to
change 2000 [m/s gr/cc] from the initial model, after 25 iterations, the
seismic inversion results represent very well both the earth model from the
well log data and the actual partial angle stacks.

estimate rock properties and facies volumes from well log and seismic
inversion attributes. This workflow uses a numerical solution to estimate a
transform to predict petrophysical properties from elastic attributes. The
transform is computed from well log-derived elastic attributes and
petrophysical properties, and posteriorly applied to seismically-derived
elastic attributes. MARS estimates a new attribute, t, in the direction of
maximum change of a target property in an n-dimensional Euclidean space formed
by n attributes. The method sequentially searches for the maximum correlation
between the target property and all of the possible attributes that can be
estimated via an axis rotation of the basis that forms the aforementioned
space.</p>

case study, for each target petrophysical property, MARS was run for a 2D
combination of the 64 elastic attributes shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-table-seismic-attributes"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 333</span></a> , which can be derived from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Ip\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Is\)</span>, resulting in the evaluation of 2016 independent bi-dimensional
spaces. In this table, each number represents a single attribute, which is
obtained after applying the mathematical operation shown in the leftmost
column to the elastic attribute shown in the uppermost row. For example, the
number 21 represents the attribute. The purpose of applying a mathematical
operation (such as square root, power, inverse, logarithm, etc.) to attributes
is to be able to model physical phenomena that exhibit nonlinear behavior.
This is a mathematical strategy to linearize potential nonlinear relationship
between the elastic attributes and the petrophysical properties, used with the

<p>The MARS approach was applied in two different depth windows, given the
different rock physics relationships between the elastic attributes and the
petrophysical properties in the Stø and Nordmela Fms. (see
<a class="reference internal" href="properties.html#fig-poisson-acoustic-impedance"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 324</span></a>). The first window comprises the
Fuglen and Stø Formations and the second window the Nordmela Formation.
The rock properties that were estimated using the MARS approach were total
porosity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_T\)</span>), volume of clay (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Vclay\)</span>) and the hybrid
petrophysical property water saturation plus volume of clay
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw+Vclay\)</span>).</p>
<p>This last property, which can take values between zero and two, was used as
input to build a litho-fluid facies volume based on the cut-off values shows
in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-lithofluid-facies"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 334</span></a>. Three litho-fluid facies were defined. The
green facies denotes zones where clean hydrocarbon bearing sands with
thickness above seismic resolution are expected to be found, including both
commercial and residual saturation given the inability of the elastic
measurements to distinguish between these two. The blue facies represents
clean wet sand or shaly hydrocarbon bearing sand or thin hydrocarbon bearing
sand that cannot be resolved at seismic resolution. These three configurations
of rock and fluid present a high degree of overlap in the elastic domain, in
consequence cannot be separated using seismic data. The last litho-fluid
facies (brown) represents the background trend that are composed of shales or
thin wet sand.</p>

<p>Once the transform to predict petrophysical properties from elastic attributes
was found for each window using well log data, the resulting relationships
were applied over the seismically-derived elastic attributes per window using
the seismic horizons (upper window: from top Fuglen to base Stø, and
bottom window: from base Stø to top Snadd), with the goal of estimating a
single 2D section of total porosity, clay content and litho-fluid facies per
2D seismic line. The litho-fluid facies section was estimated after applying
the cut-off presented in Table 3 to the seismically-derived section of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw+Vclay\)</span>. The resultant litho-fluid facies, clay content and total
porosity sections for the line 5001P1009, along with the corresponding well
log information for the Central and Alternative wells is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inversion-seismic-properties-model"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 337</span></a>. Notice the good match
between the seismic and well log-derived petrophysical property in the
calibration wells demonstrating that both were correctly predicted. In
addition, the well trajectory of the Hanssen and Bjaaland wells are also shown
(no log information is available for these wells). The former was catalogued
as a discovery well and the latter as a dry well. The litho-fluid facies
section suggests that hydrocarbon fluid is present in both locations, and
highlights the fact that seismic data alone cannot distinguish between
commercial and non-commercial hydrocarbon saturations, leaving a significant
ambiguity in prospect de-risking.</p>

<p>The final stage of the workflow is to combine the seismically derived
properties, with the electrical information derived from the CSEM data. The
goal of this stage is to reduce the uncertainty in fluid saturation that is
observed in the seismic-only results. In order to do this, electric and
elastic properties must be combined in a common domain and at a common scale
so that direct comparison, and ultimately quantitative integration is
possible.</p>

<h3>Seismically-derived resistivity estimation and transverse resistance (TR) calibration<a class="headerlink" href="#seismically-derived-resistivity-estimation-and-transverse-resistance-tr-calibration" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In order to allow direct comparison between seismic and CSEM results, the next
step in the methodology (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#fig-inversion-workflow-title"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 320</span></a>) is the
estimation of resistivity models from seismically derived properties for
different fluid saturation scenarios. With this goal in mind, we used the
seismically-derived litho-fluid facies, clay content and total porosity
sections with a calibrated rock physics model to transform these petrophysical
properties into the electrical domain. The calibrated rock physics model used
was the Simandoux equation (<span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id106" title="P. Simandoux.

<p>Parameters within the Simandoux equation were defined in the <a class="reference internal" href="properties.html#barents-sea-properties"><span class="std std-ref">properties</span></a> section. This rock physics model represents
the same one used in the petrophysical evaluation of the Central and
Alternative wells to estimate water saturation (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span>) from the
horizontal resistivity log and was calibrated in the early stage of the study.
The procedure used to estimate the seismically-derived resistivity sections at
different fluid scenarios consisted of applying directly Eqs.
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-simandoux-eq">(501)</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-simandoux-eq-phi">(502)</a> to the total porosity and volume
of clay sections (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inversion-seismic-properties-model"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 337</span></a>) for
different values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> that were modified only in those areas were the
seismic indicates the presence of clean hydrocarbon bearing sand, i.e. green
facies in the litho-fluid facies section
(<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inversion-seismic-properties-model"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 337</span></a>). The results are shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-transverse-resistivity-compare"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 338</span></a> b, c, and d, for values of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> equal to 0.1, 0.5 and 1 respectively. As a quality control of the
results for the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> = 0.1 (90% hydrocarbon saturation, which is
a saturation close to that obtained from the petrophysical evaluation at the
Central well), the measured resistivity curve was overlaid. An excellent match
with the modeled resistivity is obtained. One important observation that can
be made from the comparison of the three seismically-derived results is the
low resistivity contrasts between the reservoir and non-reservoir facies for
the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> = 0.5. This demonstrates that this level of water
saturation (or higher) cannot be identified using CSEM data in this particular
geological setting due to the high values of the background resistivity.</p>
<p>At this stage in the workflow, results have all been transformed to the
electrical domain. However, there is one further step required before a direct
comparison can be made. It is noticeable that the seismic results in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-transverse-resistivity-compare"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 338</span></a> are significantly higher
resolution than the CSEM results in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-transverse-resistivity-compare"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 338</span></a>, even when the CSEM inversion is
constrained. This difference must be resolved before the results can be
compared or combined in a quantitative fashion.</p>
<p>The simplest approach to achieving this is to upscale both seismic and CSEM
results. The reservoir parameter that is best constrained by the CSEM method
is the transverse resistance (vertically integrated resistivity). By
calculating the transverse resistance from the seismically and CSEM derive
resistivity, the difference in vertical resolution between the two methods can
be overcome, albeit at the expense of the higher resolution of the seismic
result. Transverse resistances based on CSEM and seismic results are compared
in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-transverse-resistivity-compare"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 338</span></a> a. Note that when the
resistivity is calculated from the seismic data using the Simandoux
relationship, which is calibrated to horizontal resistivity at the well, the
result is most closely related to the horizontal resistivity of the sub-
surface. The CSEM measurements, in contrast, provide a measure of both
horizontal and vertical resistivity however reservoir related structure
manifests in the vertical resistivity. To address this difference, an
empirical calibration factor of three, based on CSEM analysis of background
anisotropy, was applied to the seismically derived transverse resistance to
compensate for the electrical anisotropy observed.</p>
<p>An analysis of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-transverse-resistivity-compare"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 338</span></a> a offers important
information about the hydrocarbon saturation levels of the reservoirs and
potential reservoirs along the section. A good agreement is seen between the
CSEM and seismic transverse resistance curves at the end member positions
represented by the Central well location (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> = 0.1 - magenta curve)
and for the Alternative well location (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> = 1 - blue curve) that
corroborate the validity of the rock physics model used and the calibration
factor applied to the data. For the case of the Bjaaland well, the CSEM
derived transverse resistance most closely agrees with the lower saturation
seismically derived curves, indicating, in a semi-quantitative way, the
absence of a commercial hydrocarbon saturation at this location. Finally, for
the Hanssen well, the separation between the CSEM transverse resistance curve
and that for the wet case seismically-derived curve (blue curve) indicates the
presence of hydrocarbon saturation at least higher than 50%. However, it is
important to have in mind that a diminished CSEM-derived resistivity value is
expected to be found in this area due to the 3D effects discussed previously.
As a consequence of this the hydrocarbon saturation will be underestimated in
this case.</p>

<h3>Water Saturation Prediction<a class="headerlink" href="#water-saturation-prediction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Although the semi-quantitative comparison of transverse resistance presented
above provides valuable information on reservoir properties, it is often
desirable to derive a quantitative estimate of rock and fluid properties. The
last step in the workflow (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#fig-inversion-workflow-title"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 320</span></a>), is
therefore the quantitative prediction of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span>. The input data for
this analysis was the seismically-derived porosity, clay content and litho-
fluid facies section shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inversion-seismic-properties-model"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 337</span></a>, and CSEM-derived transverse
resistance along the CSEM line (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-transverse-resistivity-compare"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 338</span></a>
a). These datasets were inverted using the Simandoux equation calibrated at
the Central and Alternative wells, and a global search inversion method. This
method seeks the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> that provides the minimum misfit between
seismically and CSEM derived transverse resistance, using a grid search
algorithm (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sw-methodology"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 339</span></a>). It is important to mention that
only potential reservoir rocks as indicated by the seismic litho-fluid facies
(green facies in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inversion-seismic-properties-model"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 337</span></a> to the top),
were considered to have variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> during the inversion process. In
this way the quantitative seismic interpretation result not only provides
information about the clay content and total porosity of the rocks, necessary
for the Simandoux equation, but also about the location and thickness of the
potential pay sand, thus maintaining seismic resolution in the final result.
However, note that since only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> varies during the inversion, it is
implicitly assumed that the porosity and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Vclay\)</span> as defined by the
seismic data are correct.</p>

<p>The result of this inversion is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sw-misfit"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 340</span></a>. The top
panel shows the profile of the misfit obtained as a function of the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span>. This information can be interpreted as a measurement of the
robustness of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> estimation. The middle panel shows how the
optimal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> is linked to the lowest misfit value. Note that in areas
where no hydrocarbons are indicated by the seismic litho-fluid classification
shown in the bottom panel for reference (i.e. outside the green facies),
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> is set to 1. Around Wisting Central, the inversion result shows a
well constrained low <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> value, with a narrow inversion minimum. This
is as expected since at low water saturations, a small change in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span>
results in a relatively large change in resistivity. Around the Hanssen well,
the inversion minimum is wider, a result of the lower predicted saturation. At
Bjaaland, the results predict a minimum water saturation of about 50%,
consistent with the sensitivity limit suggested by well log analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, the resulting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Sw\)</span> profile was mapped back in its correct
position using the seismically-derived litho-fluid facies volume to generate a
hydrocarbon saturation section along the line
(<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-hydrocarbon-saturation"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 341</span></a>). Excellent correlation with known well
results was achieved. The integration of seismic, CSEM, and well data predicts
very high hydrocarbon saturations at Wisting Central, consistent with the
findings of the well. The slightly lower saturation at Hanssen is related to
3D effects in the CSEM data, but the outcome of the well is predicted
correctly. There is no significant saturation at Wisting Alternative, again
consistent with the findings of the well. At Bjaaland, although the seismic
indicate the presence of hydrocarbon bearing sands, the integrated
interpretation result again predicts correctly that this well was
unsuccessful.</p>
