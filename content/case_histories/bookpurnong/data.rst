The figure below is a map view of the :ref:`resolve` data in ppm. The real and
imaginary parts of 382 and 7970 Hz are shown. We can identify the area with
relatively high responses (warm color) that are potentially associated with
the saline water and low responses (cold color) for the fresher water. The
strips are from the variation of flight height.

One of the flight lines is chosen for the profile view below. We identify the
location where high conductivity may exist. We note the 35920 and 130100 Hz
data are very close, indicating the inductive limit was achieved.

The sounding below is taken from a location on the floodplain. As the
frequency increases, the imaginary part decreases and the real part increase.
This is consistent with the typical response curve in the 3-loop tutorial.

In a similar manner, we show the data on a map from four time channels. The
high responses are likely to be associated with the salinization, compatible
with the :ref:`resolve` data map. The last time channel is very noisy, but we are
still able to see a long-wavelength trend.

We also present multiple time channels along a flight line. The data set has
relatively high overall quality, except some late times are a bit noisy. This
plot help us find the appropriate noise floor.

A clean time transient decay is provided below. The variation of the decay
rate in time indicates the Earth may contain a more conductive layer under the
surface layer.
