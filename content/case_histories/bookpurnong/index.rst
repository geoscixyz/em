    This Case History is based upon two articles:
    
    `Spatially constrained inversion for quasi 3D modelling of airborne electromagnetic data – an application for environmental assessment in the Lower Murray Region of South Australia <http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1071/EG08027>`_ by Viezzoli, Auken and Munday :cite:`viezzoli2009`
    
    `Accurate  quasi  3D  versus  practical  full  3D  inversion  of  AEM  data – the  Bookpurnong  case  study <http://www.hgg.geo.au.dk/ref_manager/VIEZZOLI2010C.pdf>`_ by Viezzoli, Munday, Auken and Christiansen :cite:`viezzoli2010`
    
    Airborne EM is an important type of survey in geophysical that can be found useful in solving different geological questions, especially the ones that require quick data coverage over a large area. Hydrological and environmental studies can be good subject of airborne EM. In this case history, :ref:`airborne FDEM surveys <airborne_fdem_index>`, and :ref:`airborne TDEM surveys <airborne_tdem_index>` are used to assess the salinization at a groundwater management trial site near Bookpurnong in South Australia.
    
    The following topics are covered:

    (1) How the airborne EM can be applied in hydrogeological and environmental studies.

    (2) Airborne EM acquisition systems and airborne data.

    (3) Interpretation of airborne EM data using a 1D layered model.
