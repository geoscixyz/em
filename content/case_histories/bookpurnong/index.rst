**Abstract**



Airborne EM is an important type of survey in geophysical that can be
found useful in solving different geological questions, especially the
ones that require quick data coverage over a large area. Hydrological and
environmental studies can be good subject of airborne EM. In this case
history, :ref:`airborne FDEM surveys <airborne_fdem_index>`, and
:ref:`airborne TDEM surveys <airborne_tdem_index>` are used to assess the
salinization at a groundwater management trial site near Bookpurnong in
South Australia.

The following topics are covered:

(1) How the airborne EM can be applied in hydrogeological and environmental studies.

(2) Airborne EM acquisition systems and airborne data.

(3) Interpretation of airborne EM data using a 1D layered model.
