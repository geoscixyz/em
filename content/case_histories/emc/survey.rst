Survey
======

A ZTEM (Z-axis tipper electromagnetic technique) survey was flown over the
Elevenmile Canyone area and the flight lines are indicated in :numref:`emc2`.
The survey consists of 20 lines, separated by 200 m. Each line is
approximately 11 km long.

This was the first large-scale geophysical survey over this region. The
objective was to use the resultant information about the electrical
conductivity to further understand the structural setting of the area and also
to delineate potential features of the geothermal resource since electrical
conductivity can relate to structure, alteration, and fluid units.
