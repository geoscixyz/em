Survey
======

A ZTEM (Z-axis tipper electromagnetic technique) survey was flown over the Elevenmile Canyone area and the flight lines are indicated in :numref:`emc2`. The survey consists of 20 lines, separated by 200 m. Each line is approximately 11 km long.

This was the first large-scale geophysical survey over this region. The objective was to use the resultant information about the electrical conductivity to further understand the structural setting of the area and also to delineate potential features of the geothermal resource since electrical conductivity can relate to structure, alteration, and fluid units.
