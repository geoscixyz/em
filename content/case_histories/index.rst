Case Histories
==============

Case histories provide the context for our development of educational and
research material presented in em.geosci. Each case history focuses upon a
particular problem to be solved and provides the motivation for working with
particular surveys and shows the effectiveness of electromagnetics in
answering the posed questions. For many people, a case history will be the
entry point to this site. To facilitate transfer of knowledge we have
developed a common framework (Seven Step Process) in which each case history
is presented. Links are provided so that a reader can investigate fundamental
aspects of EM, the survey, or interpretation. In some cases we are able to
provide data sets and analysis/inversion software to enhance the user
experience and to address important issues regarding reproducability. Case
histories for our initial launch of em.geosci are those that have been
developed by past and present students at the Geophysical Inversion Facility.
The titles, and EM systems used are provided below.
