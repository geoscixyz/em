Data
====

The `MIMDAS`_ system collects both a pole-dipole (P-DP) and a dipole-pole (DP-P) configuration in general. Furthermore, both DC and IP data were collected through the system. The data are viewed prior to quality control measures.

In preparation for the inversion, a first-pass assessment of data quality is completed through visualization. While sensing the same Earth, these two configurations can yield different responses and consequently be subject to different noise levels. The :ref:`DC data <MtISa_DCR_data>` were first seperated by line and then by survey configuration.

Note that a large portion of the DP-P shows higher apparent conductivity data than observed on the P-DP configuration. This may be explained by the presence of conductive units on the eastern edge of the survey. As demonstrated with the :ref:`numerical simulation<Mt_Isa_Simulation>`, current channeling through the Breakaway Shale unit and the mineralization at depth may considerably reduce the measured potentials west of these anomalies.

Simarly, 2D pseudo-sections of :ref:`IP data<MtISa_IP_data>` are shown below for first-pass assessement through visualization. Note on several lines the large negative apparent chargeability values on the DP-P configuration. The data for this configuration were particularly noisy and exhibited apparent chargeabilities of less than -100 ms. Therefore, data that was greater than an n-spacing of 10 were removed.
