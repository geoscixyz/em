    This Case History is based upon the paper: `2-D and 3-D IP/resistivity for the interpretation of Isa-style targets <http://gif.eos.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/EG01156.pdf>`_ by Rutley, Oldenburg and Shekhtman
    :cite:`rutley2001`

    This was one of the first examples of inverting DC/IP field data to recover 3D
    distributions of resistivity and chargeability. Prior to this, the inversion
    of field data was primarily carried out in 2D. We use this case history to
    provide an example for inverting DCR and IP data and to link different parts of
    the survey and processing to the fundamentals of EM as presented in :ref:`EM.geosci <em_index>`.
    We have re-inverted the data but have kept as many details as possible
    to be the same as in the original paper. This enables us to show how current technology
    has increased the ability to recover details about the subsurface.
