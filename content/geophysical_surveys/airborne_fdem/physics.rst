    Demonstrate the fundamental physical principles governing the airborne FDEM experiment
    

Most of the physics related to airborne FDEM is available in :ref:`Maxwell I: Fundamentals <maxwell1_fundamentals_index>` and :ref:`Maxwell III: FDEM <maxwell3_fdem_index>`. In particular, readers are supposed to be familiar with the following concepts:

:ref:`Magnetic dipole <frequency_domain_magnetic_dipole_index>`. For the spatial scale we are interested in, an airborne transmitter or receiver can be effectively represented by a sufficiently small loop, or a magnetic dipole. The primary magnetic field generated by a magnetic dipole can be calculated using :ref:`Biot-Savart law <biot_savart>`. The magnetic dipole moment, calculated as the product of current and area, determines the strength of the primary magnetic field. 
  
  
:ref:`A sphere excited by a magnetic dipole <sphereFEM_freespace_index>`. A simplified scenario is to examine how the magnetic field from a magnetic dipole source interact with a sphere in free space (or a resistive background) in frequency domain. 


:ref:`A circuit model for EM induction <emi_tuotorial_index_FD>`.  A conceptual model involving three inductively coupled loops can be used to understand airborne EM. The airborne transmitter, receiver and the earth are represented by three loops in a certain orientation. The receiver is directly coupled with the transmitter loop for the primary field. It is also indirectly coupled with the transmitter loop through the earth loop, which generates the secondary field. The ratio of the secondary to the primary therefore contains the information about the conductivity of the earth loop. The 3-loop circuit model is a very useful tool, because by tuning the induction number (function of conductivity and frequency), we can see how a FEM system behaves in the resistive or inductive limits. We can further explore the effect of mutual coupling of the loop in the data for the qualitative understanding of data in practice.
