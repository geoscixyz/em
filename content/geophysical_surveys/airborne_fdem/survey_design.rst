Survey Design
=============

.. topic:: Purpose

    To discuss the principles and parameters that need to be chosen for an
    airborne FDEM survey.

Applicability of AFEM
---------------------

Choosing the instrument and the survey parameters and layout is usually
referred to as "survey design". In most cases, the first step in a geophysical
survey is to match the system parameters to the geologic task using rules of
thumbs or empirical criteria.

AFEM is mostly suitable for large survey areas with focus from the surface to
the shallow depth. It can be quickly deployed, giving a quick overview of the
regional conductivity distribution. The recording system (towed bird) is
usually smaller than a time-domain system, in which a large and rigid frame is
used to mount the transmitter loop. So it is generally the least costly
geophysical EM solution measured by dollar per line-km. Hydrological, environmental and
engineering applications are the main area AFEM is used. It can also be useful
for mineral or petroleum exploration at shallow depth.

Footprint
---------

In an AEM survey/system, a concept "footprint" is usually used to quantify the
size of the underground volume that a system is sensitive to. Footprint can be
evaluated using different formulations, but it mostly depends on the frequency
and the conductivity. Higher frequency and higher conductivity can result in a
smaller footprint. A lower flight height may also reduce the footprint. A
first-order estimate of footprint can be from :ref:`skin depth <frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources>`, which is a function of
the frequency and the conductivity.


Survey parameters
-----------------

The operating frequencies, separations and orientations of the coils in a AFEM
system are usually fixed. The only variable geophysicist need to consider in
the survey design is the line spacing. For a 3D survey, it is important to
ensure the line spacing is at least equal or smaller than the footprint, so no
"gap" is left between lines. At the locations where higher quality of data is
desired, survey lines may be dense. The line spacing is usually a
trade-off between the cost and resolution.

Another consideration is the sounding spacing. For a towed system, the in-line
spacing is adjustable by the flight speed and sampling rates, and can easily
achieve high density soundings.

Flight height can be another parameter. Generally a lower flight height is
preferred as it provides better resolution for the near surface structure
using a smaller footprint. But some practical conditions may limit the lowest
possible flight height, for example, trees, infrastructure, severe topography,
aircraft safety, etc.
