RESOLVE is a frequency-domain loop-loop system operated by CGG (previously
Fugro Airborne). The system has evolved over years, we describe RESOLVE III
system (2008) here.

Coils
*****

It operates five pairs of horizontal co-planar (HCP) coils at nominal
frequencies 400, 1800, 8200, 40000, 140000 Hz, and one pair of vertical co-
axial (VCA) coil at a nominal frequency of 3300 Hz. The operating frequencies
can be different. For the HCP configuration, the separation between
transmitter and recevier is 7.86 m. For the VCA configuration, the separation
between transmitter and recevier is 8.99 m. The measured data is the secondary
magnetic field (Hs) represented as the ratio to the primary field (Hp) in part
per million (ppm).

Flight
******

A nominal terrain clearance is 30 m. A nominal aircraft speed is 30 m/s. The
aircraft is positioned using post-processed differential GPS in processing,
and real-time satellite differential GPS in flight. A typical sampling rate is
10 Hz (approximately 3 m sounding spacing).

Corrections
***********

The service provider usually carry out corrections after the raw data are
downloaded from the instruments. Those can include: base level correction,
internal q-coil calibration, lag correction, moving window median and Hanning
filter, and leveling for the final EM channels. The laser altitude data may
also be corrected for dropouts and altitude variation. If magnetic data are
acquired, it may be lagged, diurnally corrected and then IGRF removed before
the delivery of the data to clients.
