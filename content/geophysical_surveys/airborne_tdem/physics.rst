To understand the theory of airborne FEM, knowledge in Maxwell3 and Maxwell4
are required. The physical principles of ATEM can be built base upon the
knowledge about a frequency-domain system. Essnetially, the following items
are relevant:

- Linearity. Considering the source as input and the received signal as
  output, an EM survey is a linear time-invariant system. This implies that a
  time-domain response is equal to the inverse Fourier tranformed freq-domain
  response convolved with the time-domain transmitter waveform. Therefore, the
  concepts of magnetic dipole and three-loop model, already understood in
  frequency domain, can be transformed to time domain.
