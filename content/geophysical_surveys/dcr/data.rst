Pseudo-section
--------------

The layout shown in {figure} indicates
a current electrode at postion 1 with potentials measured across all other
dipoles. The current electrode is then moved one electrode to the right.
{Verify whether potentials to the left are recorded.} This produces a pseudo-
section as shown in :numref:`Pseudo_PDP_East`.

    Data for pole moving east to west.


(d) It is desireable to illuminate the target bodies from as different
directions as possible. This motivates the second acquistion with the current
pole on the right as seen in :numref:`Pseudo_PDP_West`.
