Direct Current Resistivity
==========================

.. topic:: Purpose

    To illustrate the fundamentals of a DC resistivity survey, provide a
    vision for how it is applied in the field, and demonstrate potential uses.

Variations in :ref:`conductivity <electrical_conductivity_index>` can be
diagnostic, for example, when aiming to characterize a mineral deposit (e.g.
:ref:`Mt. Isa <mt_isa_index>`), where the conductivity of the mineralized zone
is often higher than the host rock.

In a Direct Current Resistivity (DCR) experiment, a generator is used to
inject current into the earth. The current path depends upon the variation of
:ref:`conductivity<electrical_conductivity_index>`  or equivalently, its
reciprocal, the electrical resistivity.
:ref:`Currents<fields_from_grounded_sources_dcr_index>` are channeled into
good conductors and flow around resistors. Electrical charges are :ref:`built
up<charge_buildup_at_boundaries>` on interfaces that separate units of
different conductivity and these charges generate an electric potential.

    Direct Current Resisitivity (DCR)
    experiment showing current path and
    charge built up near a (a) conductive
    and (b) resistive anomaly.


:ref:`Data<dcr_data>` are acquired at the surface or in boreholes by measuring the potential
difference between two electrodes. The measured voltage depends upon the
positions of the current and potential electrodes with respect to the target
as well as the earth's conductivity.  Obtaining information about the
spatial distribution of conductivity requires many measurements at different
locations and electrode configurations. A :ref:`Schlumberger<dcr_survey>` survey
involving two current and two potential electrodes is shown in
:numref:`DCR_intro`. Artistic representation of the current density and
charge build-ups are illustrated for (a) conductive and (b) resistive
spheres in a uniform half-space.
