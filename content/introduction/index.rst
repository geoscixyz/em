How to use this resource
------------------------

There are multiple ways to use em.geosci:

- to ask a question about some aspect of electromagnetics

    - what is :ref:`Faraday's law<faraday>`?
    - how does an electromagnetic wave decay as it propagates?
    - ...

- to obtain information about a geophysical survey (instrumentation, data acquisition, processing)
- to find :ref:`Case Histories<case_histories_index>` about the use of geophysics in solving applied problems.

These objectives are interconnected and the sequence in which the questions
are asked will depend upon the problem. The advantage of a digital resource is
that essential elements can be linked; so starting at a :ref:`Case History<case_histories_index>` for
mineral exploration might lead to querying what a time domain survey is and
this might bring the reader back to :ref:`Faraday's law<faraday>`. Alternatively, in the
presentation of Faraday's Law, there are links to time domain surveys and also
links to case history examples.

The exact organization structure of the menu is therefore inconsequential.
Even though all material is connected, we have attempted to organize the topics
into self-contained groups. Each section begins with an overview that can help
guide the reader.

A major component of learning is the ability to interact with material, that
is, to engage with the concepts that are being presented. Throughout the
resource we have embedded python notebooks that will allow the user to observe
results after changing parameters. In addition, through Examples_, the user
will be able to interface with SimPEG_, our open-source modelling and
simulation package, so that he/she can generate their own codes and test
results or carry out further exploration of a topic.
