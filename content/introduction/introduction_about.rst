Why em.geosci?
==============

Electromagnetics has not yet reached its full potential for solving problems
in the geosciences. However that is changing and today the combination of
better field systems and high quality data, advances in scientific computing,
and the exponential increase in computer power allows us to solve problems
that were not possible a few years ago. It is becoming more common-place to
acquire laboratory or in-situ measurements of physical properties and these
are essential links in tying the geophysics to questions about the earth. The
other advance is the open-source technology associated with the internet which
allows technical  material and ideas to be generated by multiple contributors
through sources like Github_. The cloud-based computing environment and
advanced software has also opened up portals for interacting with equations
and concepts in real time as material is being read. The goal of em.geosci is
to blend these items as seamlessly as possible and provide a learning
environment in which geoscientists with various backgrounds and expertise can
connect with the application of electromagnetics in their field of study.
Having a resource that allows participants to answer many different questions
connected with electromagnetics will enhance efficiency of research and
applications. Moreover, this resource provides an explicit repository for
knowledge that has been acquired by practising geoscientists and, when made
available, can elevate the learning and responsible use of electromagnetics
throughout the communinity.

What is em.geosci?
------------------

em.geosci is a conglomeration of pieces of information, stored on the cloud
using Github_, and currently organized through `Read-the-docs`_. It uses ( Juypter
...ipython.. notebooks...). It is an out-growth of the EM group at UBC-GIF
with a goal to capture our historic EM achievements and knowledge, make it
available to members of the group, expand its reach to individuals and groups
outside UBC and obtain participation from outside UBC.  It interfaces with our
other open-source software (gpg.geosci which  provides an introduction to the
use of geophysics for geoscientists; and SimPEG_ which is an open-source
forward simulation and parameter estimation resource;...).

How is it organized?
--------------------

The motivation for the structure of em.geosci follows from
:ref:`introduction_basic_electromagnetic_experiments`. The goal is to identify
topics that are logically self-contained and then use links to connect them.
At the large scale we have the following items.

- :ref:`introduction_index`: Provides motivational examples, outlines the site, takes care of housekeeping items like notation

- :ref:`physical_properties_index`: Is the "go-to" location for information about what the properties are, how they are measured, typical values etc.

- :ref:`maxwell1_fundamentals_index`: This contains items that relate to the general understanding of Maxwell's equations and how they are solved. Topics are general and not survey specific. (eg  the basic equations, interface conditions, concepts of fields and fluxes, plane waves in homogeous media, fields from electric and magnetic dipoles etc. )

- :ref:`maxwell2_static_index`: This section pertains to the understanding the steady-state Maxwell's and its applications. Foundations for DC resistivity (DCR); Magnetometric resistivity (MMR), and magnetic surveys are found here.

- :ref:`maxwell3_fdem_index`: This section pertains to understanding Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. Foundations for galvanic, inductive and natural source surveys in frequency are presented.

- :ref:`maxwell4_tdem_index`: This section pertains to understanding Maxwell's equations in the time domain.

- :ref:`geophysical_surveys_index`: Self-contained folders for individual geophysical surveys are provided. For example DCR provides a comprehensive overview about the DC resistivity survey as well as links to case histories. Each Survey is linked to relevant sections in other portions of em.geosci so that comprehensive knowledge can be accessed.

- :ref:`inversion`: This provides basic tutorial information about inversion that is applicable to all em surveys.

- :ref:`case_histories_index`: These form the cornerstones of our site. They motivate the use of EM geophysics and they also dictate what material needs to be developed in the background sections. Each case history is presented with a Seven-Step Framework.

- `Examples`_: These notebooks or script-codes are provided so that the user can experiment with parameters and ask "what if" questions. For instance, in DCR, with a grounded source, it is of interest to see how the earth currents flow in the presence of a conductive or resistive body. To keep material organized, most of the code in the examples, is stored on SimPEG_.
