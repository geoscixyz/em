.. topic:: Purpose

    By taking the Fourier transform of Maxwellâ€™s wave equation in the time
    domain we obtain the vector Helmholtz equation for the :math:`\mathbf{e}`
    or :math:`\mathbf{h}` fields. This is the starting equation for many
    problems in electromagnetics.


..todo:: alter equations to include source terms.
