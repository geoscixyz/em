    purpose here

The vector potential for a harmonic electric dipole has a simple mathematical representation yet it contains complete information about the electric and magnetic fields. We explore this function here.

For an electric current dipole in the :math:`\hat{x}` direction, and with moment :math:`I ds`, the vector potential :math:`\mathbf{A}` is

.. math::
	\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{I ds}{4\pi r} e^{-ikr} \hat{x}
	:label: A_Potential_for_Je_x

where :math:`k = (\omega^2\mu\epsilon -i\omega\mu\sigma)^{1/2}`
