    Purpose here


An electric current dipole is an infinitesimal length of wire (:math:`ds`) carrying a current :math:`I`. The strength of the dipole is given by the electric dipole moment (:math:`\mathbf{p_c}`)

.. math::
	\mathbf{p_c} = \mathbf{I}ds,


In the presence of static point charges (:math:`+q` and :math:`-q`) the electric dipole moment (:math:`\mathbf{p_q}`) is defined by the strength of the charge (:math:`q`) and the distance (:math:`\mathbf{d}`) separating the charges.

.. math::
	\mathbf{p_q} = q\mathbf{d},
