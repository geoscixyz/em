    purpose here

The vector potential for a harmonic magnetic dipole has a simple mathematical representation yet it contains complete information about the electric and magnetic fields. We explore this function here.

For an magnetic current dipole in the :math:`\hat{x}` direction, and with moment :math:`m=IS`, the vector potential :math:`\mathbf{F}` is

.. math::
	\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{i \omega \mu m}{4\pi r} e^{-ikr} \hat{x}
	:label: F_Potential_for_Jm_x

where :math:`k = (\omega^2\mu\epsilon -i\omega\mu\sigma)^{1/2}`
