    Purpose here


An magnetic dipole is an infinitesimal loop of wire of area :math:`S` carrying a current :math:`I`. The strength of the dipole is given by the magnetic dipole moment (:math:`m`)

.. math::
	m = IS

The magnetizaton vector is given by, for a loop laying in the yz plane:

.. math::
	\mathbf{M} = m \mathbf{u_x} \delta(x) \delta(y) \delta(z)
