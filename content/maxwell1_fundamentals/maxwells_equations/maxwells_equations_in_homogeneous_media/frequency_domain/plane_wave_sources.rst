Plane Wave Sources
==================

.. topic:: Purpose

    Plane wave solutions to Helmholtzâ€™s equations exist when the medium is
    homogeneous. By exploring the plane wave solution, we can understand the
    role of the complex wavenumber and see how it is related to skin depth,
    phase velocity and wavelength of the EM waves. Our content parallels that
    offered in many EM resources :cite:`ward1988,griffiths1999,stratton1941`

:ref:`Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain <frequency_domain_equations>`, without source terms, are:

.. math:: \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{E} + k^2 \mathbf{E}  = 0

.. math:: \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{H} + k^2 \mathbf{H}  = 0

where :math:`k = \sqrt{\mu \epsilon \omega^2 - i \mu \sigma \omega}` is the complex wave number. These are vector Helmholtz equations and, in a homogeneous medium, they support plane wave solutions. For ease of discussions, assume the electric and magnetic fields lie in the (x,y) plane and the wave propagates perpendicular to that plane (in the z-direction).

With this geometry, the governing equations in the electric field is

.. math:: \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial z^2} + k^2 \mathbf{E} = 0,

where :math:`\mathbf{E} \equiv \mathbf{E}(z,\omega)`. This has a solution of the following form:

.. math:: \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{\pm ikz} = 0,
        :name: fd1

where :math:`\mathbf{E}_0` is the amplitude. Writing the wave number as :math:`k = k_R + ik_I` and substituting into Equation :eq:`fd1` yields:

.. math:: \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{\pm i(k_R +ik_I)z}.
        :name: fd2

This has two terms. The first, :math:`e^{\pm ik_Rz}`, is a complex sinusoidal. The second term, :math:`e^{\pm k_Iz}`, has a real exponent and this term shows how the amplitude vaires with :math:`z`. Equation :eq:`fd2` thus corresponds to a propagating harmonic wave that decays as it travels.

To add clarity, and keep with notation that is typically used, we do the following. First, we explicitly include the time dependence :math:`e^{i\omega t}`. Second, we write

.. math:: k = \alpha + i\beta
        :name: fd3

We have chosen to keep this notation for :math:`k` since it corresponds to that used in :cite:`ward1988`. The propagating harmonic wave in time is then written as

.. math:: \mathbf{e} (z,t) \equiv \mathbf{e} = \mathbf{e}_0^+ e^{-\beta z} e^{-i(\alpha z - \omega t)} + \mathbf{e}_0^- e^{-\beta z} e^{-i(\alpha z + \omega t)}.
        :name: fd4

We begin by considering the first part of this equation. The term :math:`e^{-i(\alpha z - \omega t)}` represents a wave travelling in the positive z-direction. The phase velocity of the wave is :math:`v_{phase} = \omega/\alpha`. The initial amplitude of the wave is :math:`\mathbf{e}_0^+` and the term :math:`e^{-\beta z}` indicates that the amplitude decreases exponentially with :math:`z`. Thus in homogeneous media, the electromagnetic fields can propagate as plane waves in which their amplitude exponentially decreases with distance. The second part in Equation :eq:`fd4` is understood in the same manner except that the wave is travelling in the opposite direction (negative z-direction) and the initial amplitude is :math:`\mathbf{e}_0^-`.

General solutions of the 1D Helmholtz equations generally require waves travelling in the positive and negative z-directions. 

The magnetic field will also travel in the (x,y) plane but is perpendiculat to :math:`\mathbf{e}`.

We can investigate the plane wave propagation more fully by looking more closely at the mathematics and using an interactive app.

Wavenumber
----------

The wave number :math:`k` is:

.. math:: k = \sqrt{\mu \epsilon \omega^2 - i \mu \sigma \omega}.

Dividing :math:`k` into real and imaginary parts, and following :cite:`stratton1941,ward1988`, we have:

.. math:: k = \alpha + i \beta

.. math:: \alpha = \omega \left ( \frac{\mu \epsilon}{2} \left [ \left ( 1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2 \omega^2} \right )^{1/2} + 1 \right ] \right )^{1/2}

.. math:: \beta = \omega \left ( \frac{\mu\epsilon}{2} \left [ \left ( 1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2 \omega^2} \right)^{1/2} - 1 \right ] \right ) ^{1/2}
        :name: wn1

The wave travelling in the positive z-direction has the form:

.. math:: \mathbf{e} = \mathbf{e}_0^+ e^{-\beta z}e^{-i(\alpha z - \omega t)}.
        :name: wn2

The real and positive quantity :math:`\beta` controls how quickly the wave decays with :math:`z`. Effectively it quantifies the skin depth.

.. _frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_skin_depth:

Skin Depth
----------

The skin depth :math:`\delta` is the distance the wave travels for its amplitude to have decayed by a factor of :math:`1/e`. Thus

.. math:: \delta = \frac{1}{\beta}.

:numref:`sd` illustrates the concept of skin depth.

.. figure:: images/skindepth.png
        :figwidth: 50%
        :align: right
        :name: sd

        Skindepth is defined as the depth at which the amplitude of the wave has been reduced by :math:`1/e`.

From Equation :eq:`wn1`, it is seen that :math:`\beta`, and hence :math:`\delta`, are dependent upon the ratios of physical properties and frequency. For many geophysical surveys, we have :math:`\frac{\epsilon \omega}{\sigma} \lt \lt 1` and :math:`k` is well-approximated as:

.. math:: k = \sqrt{-i\omega \mu \sigma}.

So

.. math:: \alpha = \beta = \left ( \frac{\omega \mu \sigma}{2} \right ) ^{1/2}.
        :name: wn4

Thus the skin depth becomes:

.. math:: \delta = \frac{1}{\beta} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega \mu \sigma}}.

Assuming permeability of free space, :math:`\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}` H/m, and writing :math:`\omega=2\pi f`, we obtain the following useful equation for :math:`\delta` in meters:

.. math:: \delta \approx 503 \sqrt{\frac{1}{f \sigma}} = 503 \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{f}}.

For problems involving high frequencies, for example GPR surveys, or very early time transient EM problems, the displacement current may be important. Then Equation :eq:`wn1` needs to be invoked.

.. _frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_phase_velocity:

Phase Velocity
--------------

The complex sinusoidal term :math:`e^{-i(\alpha z - \omega t}` in Equation :eq:`wn2` represents a travelling wave. The phase velocity is expressed as:

.. math:: v_{phase} = \frac{\omega}{\alpha}.

For situations where displacement currents are negligible, :math:`\alpha` is given by Equation :eq:`wn4` and the plane wave velocity becomes

.. math:: v_{phase} = \sqrt{ \frac{2\omega}{\mu \sigma} },

so velocity increases with frequency but they travel more slowly in conductive permeable media. Alternatively, in materials where the conductivity is zero, then:

.. math:: k = \alpha = \sqrt{\mu \epsilon \omega^2}

and

.. math:: v_{phase} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}.
        :name: wn3

In free space, Equation :eq:`wn3` equates to :math:`3\times 10^8` m/s, which is the speed of light.

.. _frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_wavelength:

Wavelength
----------

.. figure:: images/planewaveprop.PNG
        :figwidth: 20%
        :align: right
        :name: pwp
        
        A plane harmonic wave propagates into the earth.

Finally, the wavelength of the waves is given by:

.. math:: \lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{\omega}{\alpha f} = \frac{2\pi}{\alpha}.

In free space, :math:`\lambda = \frac{3\times10^8}{f}`. In a conducting medium, if the quasistatice approximation is valid, then :math:`\alpha = \beta = 1/\delta` and so :math:`\lambda = 2\pi \delta`.

Thus even though the waves have a sinusoidal description inside the earth, they have lost most of their amplitude by the time they have propagated one wavelength into the earth. The above elements are illustrated in :numref:`pwp` where a plane harmonic wave in free space propagates into the earth.
