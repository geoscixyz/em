Plane Wave Sources
==================

.. topic:: Purpose

    Plane wave solutions to Helmholtz’s equations exist when the medium is
    homogeneous. By exploring the plane wave solution, we can understand the
    role of the complex wavenumber and see how it is related to skin depth,
    phase velocity and wavelength of the EM waves. Our content parallels that
    offered in many EM resources :cite:`ward1988,griffiths1999,stratton1941`
