Time Domain Equations
=====================

.. topic:: Purpose

    We combine the first-order partial :ref:`differential equations
    <differential_equations_time>` into second-order equations for :math:`\mathbf{e}`
    or :math:`\mathbf{h}` in the time domain. The equation has both a wave propagation
    and a diffusion term. When :math:`\sigma` is zero the wave propagates without
    attenuation. For most earth problems the diffusion term dominates and the
    electromagnetic equation  behave like the heat equation.


..todo:: alter equations to include source terms
