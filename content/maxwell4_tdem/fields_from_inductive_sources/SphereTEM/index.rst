Sphere
------

**Purpose**: Here, we examine the time-domain response from a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere in free-space.
Expressions provided in this section can be used to characterize the time-domain domain responses from compact ore bodies and unexploded ordnance items.

Our analysis is performed using expressions derived by Wait and Spies (1969); who considered the dipole response from a sphere under the influence of a uniform harmonic.
The problem geometry is illustrated in Figure (:numref:`SphereTEMfreespace`), where :math:`h_0 (t)` represents the inducing field from a transmitter :math:`Tx` and :math:`h_s(t)` represents the sphere’s dipole response at some receiver location :math:`Rx`.
