**Purpose**: Here, we examine the time-domain response from a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere in free-space.
Expressions provided in this section can be used to characterize the time-domain domain responses from compact ore bodies and unexploded ordnance items.

Our analysis is performed using expressions derived by Wait and Spies (1969); who considered the dipole response from a sphere under the influence of a uniform harmonic.
The problem geometry is illustrated in Figure (:numref:`SphereTEMfreespace`), where :math:`h_0 (t)` represents the inducing field from a transmitter :math:`Tx` and :math:`h_s(t)` represents the sphere's dipole response at some receiver location :math:`Rx`.

    Response :math:`h_s (t)` from a sphere in free-space under the influence of time-dependent field :math:`h_0(t)`.


**Structure**: Our analysis of the sphere's time-domain response is presented in four parts:

1. General Formulation: Here, a general formulation for the sphere's time-domain response is presented according to Wait and Spies (1969).
These expressions characterize the sphere's dipole response under the influence of a spatially homogeneous field.

2. Transient Response: In many cases, we are interested in the transient or "step-off" response from a target body.
Here, we examine the sphere's transient response and its dependence on the sphere's physical properties for several special cases.

3. Impulse Response: The sphere's time-dependent response to an arbitrary excitation is characterized by its impulse response.
Here, the impulse response for several special cases are discussed.

4. Analytic Derivation: Here, abbravation derivations for the sphere's step-response and impulse response are presented for a conductive and magnetically permeable Earth.
These derivations can be found in Spies (1951) and Wait and Spies (1969).
