Summary
-------


The constitutive equations provide the connections between the fields and fluxes in Maxwell's equations. The coefficient that links these entities is a physical property. For each constitutive relation we provide:
- constitutive equation and its physical understanding
- a laboratory setup
- some history (if available)
- units and references
