Archie's Law
============

Archie defined an empirical relationship which considers above factors defining the conductivity of a sedimentary rock. Archie’s law can be written as

.. math::
	\sigma = F^{-1} \sigma_w S_w^{n},
	:label: Archies_cond

where :math:`S_w` is the water saturation, :math:`\sigma_w` is the conductivity of the brine, and :math:`F` is the formation factor. In resistivity form, this can be written as

.. math::
	\rho = F \rho_w S_w^{-n},
	:label: Archies_resis

where :math:`\rho_w` is the resistivity of the brine. The formation factor is defined as

.. math::
	F = \frac{a}{\phi^m} = \frac{\sigma_w}{\sigma_o} = \frac{\rho_o}{\rho_w},
	:label: Archies_formationfactor


where :math:`\sigma_o` and :math:`\rho_o` are the conductivity and resistivity of the rock filled with only brine (:math:`S_w=1`), respectively. Here m is the cementation factor (usually in the range of 1.3<m<2.3), n is the saturation exponent (usually close to 2), and a is tortuosity factor.
The cementation factor describes how much the pore network decreases the conductivity (assuming rock itself is not conductive). The more consolidated rock usually have the greater cementation factor, which is effectively related to the pressure:

	- For slightly consolidated sandstones m=1.4
	- For consolidated sandstones m=1.7

Tortuosity factor describes the excess length of the equivalent electrolyte path relative to the rock specimen length, hence the greater tortuosity makes the greater porosity resulting in higher conductivity.

The resistivity index can be written as

.. math::
	RI = \frac{\rho}{\rho_w} = S_w^{-n},
	:label: Archies_RI

.. note::
	Archie’s law is purely empirical law intending to describe ion flow in clean and consolidated sands. Electrical conduction is assumed not to be present within the rock grains. Hence it may not work for a rock includes considerable amount of clay minerals because a clay or shale particle acts as a separate conducting path.
