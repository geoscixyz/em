Cole Cole Conductivity
======================

Because resistivity is the inverse of conductivity (:math:`\sigma = 1 / \rho`), we could have conductivity form of Cole-Cole model as well. Depending on situations either resistivity or conductivity form can be advantageous, hence we consider a conductivity form:

.. math::
    \sigma(\omega) = \sigma_{\infty}\Big(1-\frac{\eta}{1+(1-\eta)(\imath\omega\tau)^c} \Big),
    :label: colecole_pelton_sig

where :math:`\sigma_{\infty}` is conductivity at infinite frequency, :math:`\eta` is chargeability, :math:`\tau` (s) is a time constant, :math:`c` is a frequency dependency.

.. note::
	In a resistivity form we use resistivity at zero frequency, :math:`\rho_0 = 1/\sigma_0`, to express Cole-Cole model. However, in conductivity form we use conductivity at infinite frequency, :math:`\sigma_{\infty}`. Conductivity at zero freuency can be expressed as :math:`\sigma_{0} = \sigma_{\infty}(1-\eta)`

.. todo::
	Add when useful to use conductivity form
