Characteristic mechanisms for IP
================================

The chargeability of earth materials is essentially an electrochemical effect caused by many factors, not all of which are completely understood. If ground is chargeable, it responds as if resistivity was a complex quantity - it behaves somewhat like a leaky capacitor. Therefore the chargeability can be measured in a number of ways using time domain or frequency domain techniques.
Aspects affecting the chargeability of a sample include:

	 - the grain size of particles in the sample;
	 - the type and mobility of ions within the pore fluids;
	 - the details of microscopic interactions between solid surfaces and fluids;
	 - the amount of surface area within a specific volume.

The surface area-to-volume ratio is an important factor. Clays tend to be chargeable while sandstones are not, and the images here illustrate one reason why this is true. In addition, the surface interactions between clay minerals and fluids enhance the ability of these materials to hold charges.

Two microscopic effects cause macroscopic chargeability
-------------------------------------------------------

There are two primary causes of chargeability. In both cases the re-distribution of charges takes some time to occur when an external DC electric field is applied. Equivalently, it takes the same time to revert to a balanced charge distribution once the electric field is removed. "Charging" is hard to measure in practice. "Discharging" is measured using time domain IP survey techniques. The effect of finite charging time on sinusoidal signals at different frequencies also can be measured using frequency domain or phase IP surveys. The two types of polarization are called "membrane polarization" and "electrode polarization."

.. note::

	- Induced polarization is greater when there are larger regions of
	  adsorbed anomalous charge (adjacent to an interface); i.e. when there is
	  a large surface area-to-volume ratio.

	- Non-ionic fluids (such as contaminants) can markedly change the
	  behavior of surface-electrolyte interactions.

	- Changes in ion concentration (such as increased salinity) will also
	  affect both types of polarization.

	- Both effects (membrane and electrode polarization) are related to grain
	  size as much as material type. Therefore, discrimination of mineral type
	  on the basis of chargeability alone is not recommended.
