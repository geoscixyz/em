Membrane polarization
=====================

Membrane polarization occurs when pore space narrows to within several
boundary layer thicknesses (which is the thickness of ions adsorbed to a
surface).

	:scale: 100 %

Charges cannot flow easily, so they accumulate when an electric field is
applied.

The result is a net charge dipole which adds to any other voltages measured at
the surface.

A second form of membrane polarization is similar to the first:

	:scale: 100	%

This occurs where clay particles partially block ionic solution paths, as in
the adjacent figure. Upon application of an electric potential, positive
charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers accumulate. There is an
"ion-selective membrane."

A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end of the membrane, while
a deficiency occurs at the other end. The reduction of mobility is most
obvious at frequencies slower than the diffusion time of ions between adjacent
membrane zones; i.e. slower than around 0.1 Hz. Conductivity increases at
higher frequencies.
