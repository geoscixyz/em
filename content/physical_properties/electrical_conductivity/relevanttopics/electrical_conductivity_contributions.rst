Contributions to rock conductivity
==================================

Here are common factors determine conductivity of a rock:

	- Metallic particles
	- Electrolyte in the pore of a rock with large number of ions
	- Temperature
	- Pressure
	- Porosity
	- Rock texture
	- Clay materials

If a rock includes metallic particles, obviously that rock will be conductive (electric conduction).

Each ion is able to only a certain quantity of charge, it indicates that the more ions in an solution and faster they move, the greater charge will be carried which result in greater conductivity of a rock. Hence, the solution with the greater number of ions will have higher conductivity. Accordingly, a rock which includes saline water within its pores will have larger conductivity when the salinity of the water is higher than when it is lower.

An increase in temperature will increase the mobility of ions in the solution resulting in an increase of the conductivity. Based upon that temperature increase and salinity decrease with depth, conductivity should increase with depth. However, the effect of pressure should be considered to understand conductivity of the earth with depth as we shall explore later.

Most minerals forming rocks are nonconductive. However, the porosity and pore distribution of a rock specimen will have effect on determining conductivity. In addition, clay minerals in a rock can be a separate conducting path from electrolyte conduction, which will increase the conductivity of a rock.
