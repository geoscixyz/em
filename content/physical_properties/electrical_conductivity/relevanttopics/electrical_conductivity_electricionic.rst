Electric and Ionic conductivity
===============================

Electrical conductivity is the movement of electrical charge from on location to another, and two important charge carriers are electrons and ions, which will define the conductivity of a rock. Considering this, we express conductivity as

.. math::
	\sigma = n e \mu_e,

where :math:`n` is the number of charge carriers, :math:`e` is charge carried by each charge carrier, and :math:`\mu_e` is the mobility of carriers. Hence, the conductivity of a rock can be determined by its capability to move charges by charge carriers: electrons and ions. This classifies two main different types: a) Electric and b) Ionic conductions.

Electric conductivity
---------------------

Both conductions are related to random motion of particles affected by an applied electric field. However, how charge moves in conduction processes are quite different. The charge carrier for the electric conduction is electron, which will define conductivity of most metals such as iron and copper. The random motion of valence electrons (a measure of its combining power with other atoms) among the atom is ordered by the application of an external electric field. The electrons then travel with a drift velocity through solid.


Ionic conductivity
------------------

Conduction in surface rocks is mostly electrolytic, taking place in the connected pore spaces, along grain boundaries and in fractures, but negligibly through the mineral grains or silicate framework :cite:`ward1990`. For this case, the charge carrier is mostly ions dissolved in an electrolyte, so we often call this as ionic conductivity. Ionic conductivity of a rock is ranging from :math:`10^{3}`-:math:`10^{-5}` S/m. Porous media such as rocks at the earthâ€™s surface that we are usually dealing with can be considered to solid semi-conductor.

Ionic conductivity is resulting from the ordered movement of ions in an electrolyte under the application of an external electric field. Without an external electric field, the ions move randomly as a result of thermal agitation and collisions with other ions and atoms. Because both cations (+) and anions (-) are present in an electrolyte, the conductivity can be expressed as

	.. math::

		\sigma = e(n^+\mu_m^+ + n^-\mu_m^-),

where :math:`n` is the number of charge carriers, :math:`e` is the charge carried, and :math:`\mu_m` is the mobility of the carriers. Here superscripts + and - stand for cation and anion.
