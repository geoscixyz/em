Magnetic Permeability
=====================


Motivating Examples:  (For each of these; just a picture and a statement of the problem; 
- UXO (EM survey over a conductive and permeable target)
- Exploration for a magnetic, non-conductive body using a controlled source 
- Contamination of a time domain survey with viscous soils. 

..Purpose:: 
 	 ?? Magnetic permeability is a physical property that  relates the magnetic flux density (B) to the strength of the magnetic field intensity (H). It  quantifies how a rock can become magnetized in the presence of an external field. The full understanding of magnetic permeability and rock magnetization is complex. We concentrate upon it here for two reasons: (a) we sometimes search for bodies with high magnetic permeability (eg UXO); (b) electromagnetic instruments measure B or its time derivate, and the fields from a magnetized rock adds to the magnetic fields arising from currents in the earth and hence makes recovering information about conductivity more difficult (eg. nickel sulfides; ground TEM with superparamagnetic effects). The magnetic properties of many rocks and soils are characterized by the magnetic susceptibilty. This quantity, often referred to as a physical property, can also have a frequency dependence. In this section we connect magnetic permeability with some of its applications through case histories, investigate the constitutive relationship and its laboratory foundation, compile useful tables and provide additional levels of information that are valuable. 


..todo:: 
	need something about B, mu, H here
	Same level as intro for conductivity (need to coorinate these)


Case Histories: (none yet, but leave a link)

Constitutive Relationship and Laboratory Measurements
	Lab measurements and how they are performed (also add, if found, a photo from a real lab)
	Material including eq 17-24
	mu_s= alpha/(R-R0)

	?? some synoptic comments about mu and different types of permeability; paramagnetic, ferro/ferri (these might later have a section of relevance) For now these become important words that serve as place holders to more indepth material when needed.

	Magnetic susceptibility:  (material eq 9-13)

Useful Tables:
	Table for rocks ... (more information from units go here also)

Additional Material
	To be determined
