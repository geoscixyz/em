Impact of Mineralogy on Magnetic Properties
===========================================

Magnetism in rocks is primarily attributed to the presence of iron-bearing
minerals. These minerals, and their relative importance in rock magnetism, are
listed here. The magnetic susceptibilities of common rock types are discussed
qualitatively.

Important Iron-Bearing Minerals
-------------------------------

Magnetite, titano-magnetite and maghemite are ferrimagnetic minerals, and
exhibit very strong induced magnetization; with magnetite being the most
susceptible. Even in small abundances, these iron-oxide minerals frequently
represent the dominant contribution towards a rock's magnetic susceptibility.
Certain sulfide minerals, such as pyrrhotite and greigite, are also
ferrimagnetic and capable of experiencing strong induced magnetization. Other
iron-bearing minerals may be weakly paramagnetic. If sufficiently abundant
however, they offer a secondary contribution towards the rock's magnetic
susceptibility. Notable paramagnetic minerals include: lepidocrosite,
dolomite, biotite, siderite, and fayalite. Anti-ferrimagnetic minerals, most
notably hematite, exhibit extremely weak induced magnetization. As a result,
their contribution is considered more or less negligible.

Magnetic Susceptibility of Various Rock Types
---------------------------------------------

For reference, the typical range of intrinsic magnetic susceptibilities for
various rock types can be found at the bottom of the page. The magnetic
susceptibility of a rock ultimately depends on its mineralogy. Rocks
containing higher abundances of magnetite, titano-magnetite and maghemite are
more susceptible. Magnetite is frequently the dominant source of magnetic
susceptibility in rocks. A rough estimate of magnetic susceptibility based on

Igneous
^^^^^^^

The magnetic susceptibility of igneous rocks depends on the temperature,
pressure, and composition of the parent magma. These parameters determine the
abundance and type of iron-bearing minerals which are present once the magma
has cooled. In general, felsic igneous rocks are characterized as having a
lower iron content than mafic rocks. As a result, their magnetic
susceptibilities are frequently smaller in comparison.

Sedimentary
^^^^^^^^^^^

The magnetic susceptibility of a sedimentary rock depends on the mineralogy of
its parent material, as well as its weathering history. Clays, shales,
carbonates and sandstones are not typically susceptible. In laterites,
weathering has leached out more soluble minerals, leaving behind minerals
which are rich in iron and aluminium. Laterities therefore have the potential
to be somewhat susceptible. Banded-iron formations are a class of sedimentary
rock, characterized by alternating layers of chert/shale and
magnetite/hematite. Magnetite-rich banded-iron formations are one of the most
susceptible rock types.

Metamorphic
^^^^^^^^^^^

Metamorphism changes the mineral composition of pre-existing rock by supplying
heat, pressure and chemically active fluids. Some rocks become enriched with
magnetite and pyrrhotite during metamorphism, making them more susceptible.
Skarns and mineralized veins frequently exhibit high magnetic
susceptibilities. In general, unmineralized metamorphic rocks exhibit a broad
range of magnetic susceptibilities. These rocks include: metasediments,
amphibolites, granulites, eclogites and schists.
