Units & Typical Values for Rocks
================================

Magnetization and the magnetic field intensity are both in units of Amp\`{e}res per meter (A/m).
Therefore, the SI units for magnetic susceptibility are (A/m)/(A/m).
For this reason, the magnetic susceptibility is commonly expressed as a uniktless quantity.
Magnetic susceptibilities are occasionally given in CGS units. The conversion between SI and CGS units is given by:

.. math::
	\chi^{(SI)} = 4\pi \chi^{(CGS)}
	:label: SI_to_CGS

SI units for the magnetic permeability are Henries per meter (H/m).
Classically, the Henry represents a unit of inductance.
Therefore, the magnetic permeability represents a factor of magnetic inductance per unit length for the material.
SI units for the magnetic flux density are the Tesla (T). Teslas are equivalent to the total magnetic flux, given by the Weber (Wb), per unit area.
Thus:

.. math::
	1 \; T = 1 \; \frac{Wb}{m^2} 
	:label: Units_Tesla_Weber
	
Using units of (A/m) for the magnetic field intensity, the magnetic permeability can be expressed in units of:

.. math::
	\frac{H}{m} = \frac{T \cdot m}{A} = \frac{Wb}{A \cdot m}
	:label: Units_Hm_WbAm

Therefore, magnetic permeability can be defined as the total magnetic flux per unit length per unit field intensity a rock experiences.
The range of magnetic susceptibilities (in SI) for rocks is illustrated is Figure (needs reference).
