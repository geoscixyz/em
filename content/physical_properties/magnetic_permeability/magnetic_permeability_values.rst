Typical Values for Rocks
========================

The range of magnetic susceptibilities (in SI) for rocks is illustrated in the
figure below (Adapted from Clark and Emerson, 1991). Recall that a
relationship between the magnetic permeability and magnetic susceptibility is
defined in the :ref:`units section <magnetic_permeability_units>`.

    Intrinsic magnetic susceptibilities for common rock types. Adapted from
    Clark and Emerson (1991). Black and white bars are used to provide the
    range of magnetic susceptibility values for more distinct rock types.
    Vertical dashed red lines are used to represent the approximate magnetic
    susceptibility of rocks, based on \% volume magnetite.
