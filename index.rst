Electromagnetic Geophysics
==========================

.. topic:: Purpose

   To facilitate the understanding and use of
   electromagnetics in solving exploration, geotechnical and environmental
   problems.

The emphasis is on  physical principles of electromagnetic methods and their
application in solving problems. Rigorous analytic solutions of the EM
problems with specific transmitting fields and earth models is left to
existing books and research papers. Also, the resource does not concentrate
upon the scientific computing aspects to numerically solve Maxwell’s
equations. We do however, make much use of software that can perform those
functions. Rather, our emphasis is on using analytic and numerical solutions
to understand electromagnetic  fields and fluxes obtained from various types
of transmitters in different geological environments.

Our emphasis is on fundamentals and applications and correspondingly
:ref:`case_histories_index` play an essential role. These provide the
motivation for using electromagnetics and show the success, or not, of their
application in making an impact upon the problem at hand.

This resource is Open Source and while currently being developed by brilliant
and enthusiastic graduate students and faculty at UBC, the vision is to have
experts, worldwide, contribute. Join the development on github_.

EM GeoSci is under active construction. We are working to fill in blank
pages and address todo's. Our  goal is to have a mature version available by the
beginning of 2017. In the meantime, we are making this resource available and
`inviting contributions for case histories <http://disc2017.geosci.xyz/#contribute>`_.
